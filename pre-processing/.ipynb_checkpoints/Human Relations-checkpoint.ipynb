mechanisms work different contexts.collective efficacy concept collective efficacy defined group shared belief conjoint capabilities organize execute courses action required produce given levels attainment salanova concept based social cognitive theory bandura which posits that people actions shaped beliefs formed over time result their social interactions.this means that work context employees only likely attempt changing work designed organized managed they believe that they cope with challenges they might face process. collective efficacy simply efficacy beliefs individual

collective efficacy been found moderate stress buffering effect control that increased control particularly positive effects well being when collective efficacy also high schaubroeck .others have argued that collective efficacy important component both employees psychological empowerment organizational readiness change relation successfully implementing worksite health safety programs mcquiston weiner . more general level been argued that efficacy belief contributes positive gain spirals example increasing employees work engagement llorens salanova such positive gain spirals reflected intervention outcome.overall potential mechanism pois that participatory activities both influence participating employees collective efficacy beliefs that larger effect will seen

pois with emphasis relationship between leaders followers influence line managers behaviour towards more transformational leadership style. example line managers exercise idealized influence focusing moral commitment bass riggio such prioritizing employees longterm health over short term financial gains during discussions work environment. trust openness crucial pois employees need trust there hidden motives behind changes introduced aust .line managers also engage inspirational motivation formulating clear vision engaging followers achieve this vision nielsen .line managers promote intellectual stimulation pois challenging followers think ways doing work that improve employees health well being. finally line managers display individualized consideration taking into account needs individual employees bass riggio showing consideration employees suggestions pois.empirically some studies have demonstrated that pois change managers communicate with perceived employees bourbonnais that when leaders were responsible action planning they were seen more supportive empowering fair bjorklund . effects transformational leadership intervention outcome they promote employee engagement facilitate collaborative atmosphere between employees managers transformational leadership behaviours judge piccolo turn likely increase positive effects pois. transformational leaders successful creating strong identification within employee group might influence employees health related behaviours haslam .however transformational leaders also influence employees work characteristics this mediated effect seems account important part well established relationship between transformational leadership employee wellbeing fernet nielsen . participatory interventions transformational leadership behaviours have also been shown predict health related outcomes through line managers attitudes actions towards intervention lundmark .indeed managers display range facilitatory behaviours that indicative transformational leadership style participatory settings such inviting employees take part discussions offering support intellectual stimulation through discussions employees suggestions implemented yeung . thus plausible that increases transformational leadership behaviours mechanism which pois could improve employees manage psychosocial work environment. therefore hypothesize following hypothesis will lead increases transformational leadership which turn leads increases awareness capability manage psychosocial work environment .transformational leadership

anything action planning workshop .perceived decision latitude another contextual factor that have hindered mechanism collective efficacy from being triggered. observer noted that employees felt that only management could make decisions about anything important. third contextual factor hindering mechanism collective efficacy that some employees felt that similar concepts been tried previously with little success that applicable their company since complex production documentation demands made action plans difficult develop implement. observer noted that comparison much agreement team been what problems there clear apathy.there consensus team that possible solve anything follow workshop .together these contextual factors suggest that mechanism collective efficacy unlikely triggered context .mediational mechanism transformational leadership . contextual factor workshops likely hindering transformational leadership mechanism line manager very directive approach during which ensured that action plans would developed caused conflict negative atmosphere. observer noted that line manager threatens employee that explains about problematic aspect work mapping workshop . line manager continuously demands that employees more point precise even though line manager beginning noted that psychosocial working environment very important. repeatedly prioritizes technical solutions mapping workshop .mediational mechanism collective efficacy . negative atmosphere workshops likely only have hindered mechanism transformational leadership human relations from being triggered negative mood directive approach might have negative impact collective efficacy participants well. line manager been part company more than decades some teams seemed used behaviour tried focus task hand. observer noted that action plan development moving forward there long pauses defeatist mood instead willingness business action planning workshop .this suggests that context might have supported action plan development implementation mechanisms transformational leadership collective efficacy were likely triggered. effect line manager behaviour mechanism transformational leadership seen interviews with participating line manager where explains view role workshops line manager there wasn line manager present midwife think would difficult employees.interviewer then good that participated.line manager must crucial.because demand .people humble employees meeting with head production they might barely know. interview with line manager when asked about collaboration with line manager during project foreman described workshop context foreman most part think quite constructive. people have right express their options that point view.interviewer positive that there open .foreman will that line manager should have kept distance. puts discussions working conditions. realistic picture when present. interview with foreman foreman also explained that line manager useful implementing action plans underscored some issues there were some workshops where things loud almost argument. productive employees interview with foreman .again this interpretation behaviour attitudes line manager indicates that mechanisms transformational leadership collective efficacy were triggered.however with regard context intervention process whole another foreman noted that processes developing implementing action plans were very positive transparent even though several very ambitious plans were infeasible overall been positive.there haven been substantial obstacles. employees have been able that plans they developed have been implemented. least they have gotten answer they haven been implemented. they have been flat rejected. interview with foreman abildgaard . analysis context suggests that primary outcomes workshops were action plans changes working conditions which have direct effect employees perceived ability manage psychosocial work environment . however seems unlikely that context would trigger mechanisms collective efficacy transformational leadership.mediational mechanism collective efficacy . constructive dialogue between employees experiences empowerment have triggered mechanism collective efficacy.although employees problematic relationships with line manager observer noted finally there seems develop dialogue engagement workshop.employees start share knowledge they start joking with each other action planning workshop . addition employee says need action plan that they feel clearly empowered action planning workshop .these contextual factors suggest that mechanism collective efficacy triggered . also noted that employees come with good ideas focus dialog collaboration task improving relation between night shifts action planning workshop . relation action plan develop collaboration between shifts employee explained that they experienced . more team cohesion more cooperation with people talking more each other. more information also. help from shift improved under much time pressure used . interview with night shift employee mediational mechanism transformational leadership . contextual factor that have hindered mechanism transformational leadership tense relationship between employees line manager.some participants mapping workshop explicitly mentioned that they would have liked mood have been more positive. some workshops differences opinion were recognized positive manner others collaboration problems made assessment dialogue difficult. observer noted that . discussion stops consultant asks about collaboration with line manager. problem with machines running surfaces line manager immediately gets defensive. view does angry fashion machines shut down. mapping workshop contextual factor line manager listening skills also noted problematic action planning phase line manager listening what employees have action planning workshop .this suggests that mechanism transformational leadership triggered.analysis context supports interpretation that mechanism collective efficacy triggered that transformational leadership . human relations discussion using realist evaluation framework mixed methods approach this study aimed explore whether proposed mechanisms transformational leadership collective efficacy were triggered participatory organizational intervention three different organizations. main finding that proposed mechanisms were activated some extent increases awareness capability manage psychosocial work environment every organizational context. direct effect seen overall model figure models figure proving that reasonably robust. mechanism transformational leadership statistically significant company. modelled path from transformational leadership proved context invariantly significant . significant each company figures . mechanism improved collective efficacy supported model spite contextual factors such experiences empowerment positive dialogue.interpreting results suggests that direction mediational effects different between companies that these effects differ across mechanisms. indirect paths specifically decline transformational leadership though significant still detract from significant direct effect causing total effect smaller significant. total effect larger than direct effect suggesting that indirect paths boost effect intervention. initial interpretation results that intervention mainly positive developments three workplaces hence appears have been successful least some extent. this interpretation supports semmer suggestion that interventions generally have positive always simple effects. results suggest that employees each company benefit from intervention they benefit depends context context interacts with intervention mechanisms produce outcomes.collective efficacy results study regarding collective efficacy failed support .collective efficacy positively related only overall model only intervention related collective efficacy.each component mechanism triggered different models whole mechanism triggered model. this likely caused part reduced statistical power individual company models relative overall model. clear positive changes collective efficacy lead increases relatively high prevalence short term employees play role this outcome. contrast some employees reportedly treated their jobs merely temporary suggesting that these employees have opted wait problems rather than make effort manage work environment produce outcomes that they benefit from themselves. case results from suggest that possible increase collective efficacy.though intervention only have minor improvement work environment have improved employees collective efficacy which will hopefully allow them better cope with future challenges they face.abildgaard . transformational leadership study provides interesting results regarding .though transformational leadership models related model showed statistically significant intervention effects transformational leadership though showed positive significant increases.though pois often assumed target work environment directly they often rely there being satisfactory employee manager relationships especially when managers present activities.when quantitative model triangulated with qualitative data especially from unsurprising that mechanism transformational leadership mediate effect managers were seemingly neither able transformational manner during workshops workshops venue develop such leadership style. this sense some degree positive experience leadership seems prerequisite activation mediational mechanism transformational leadership.that poor preconditions inhibit indirect effects regarding transformational leadership perhaps owing those leaders lacking capabilities being unable learn benefit from intervention well potentially existing conflicted relationship with their employees inhibiting mediation transformational leadership.previous research found link between leadership especially transformational leadership implementation outcome interventions which this study least partially supports lundmark .implications research several recent studies have focused complex mechanisms underpinning interventions have improved understanding working mechanisms such endeavours notable examples include busch holman axtell lundmark thiele schwarz .with regard present study novel aspect testing several mechanisms three different contexts. qualitative results from three companies shed light contextual factors that play substantial role shaping possibilities different mechanisms activated suggested realist evaluation framework presented nielsen abildgaard .this aligns with expands upon theorized importance conducting intervention that fits specific context randall .regarding dynamic role context factors organizational context often seemed influence workshops which made assessment intervention mechanisms quite complex. necessary further develop refine methods assess interplay between context mechanism outcomes suggested nielsen miraglia . clear implication from study that inadequate address question only what works whom which circumstances pawson instead needs even more contextually specific does intervention work under different circumstances that line managers managerial style could hinder enable mechanism transformational leadership. addition employees experiences with regard atmosphere workshops potential experience empowerment could enable hinder mechanism collective efficacy. analysis demonstration crucial interplay between context mechanisms creating outcomes. human relations suggests that need move away from working with interventions they were bounded mechanism their right seeing them collections potential mechanisms processes that interact with contextual factors.hence evaluations complex participatory interventions should analyse multiple paths these activated differently across multiple contexts. this regard should advance analysis that encompasses complexity contextually situated nature interventions. important underscore that mechanisms examined present article necessarily most powerful present intervention.only through future research achieve comprehensive description potentially relevant mechanisms examine their relevance intervention given case.implications practice from organizational development perspective findings that mechanisms transformational leadership collective efficacy were each only activated three companies suggests that practitioners should aware partial activation mediating mechanisms might caused local circumstances potentially preventing interventions from having their full effects. example participating managers able espouse values intervention their actions positive effects participatory interventions might reduced. taking compensatory steps such including mainly work groups whose managers thought able exhibit transformational behaviours encouraging managers practitioners might increase likelihood successful implementation. short consultants other agents conducting pois should consider which mechanisms they utilize specific contexts bring about intended outcome. study also demonstrated might increase both line managers transformational leadership behaviours employees collective efficacy although these effects were only seen context each.thus practitioners should consider whether possible pois venue developing managers leadership behaviour well employees cooperate around changing their working conditions.likewise should considered whether probability these effects occurring could increased example supporting pois with leadership training.additionally improvements through pois could beneficial participants subsequent efforts improve work environment outside . example participants learn valuable lessons about influence work environment become motivated similar approaches. other words participants become more reflexive options available them form double loop learning argyris .strengths limitations this study features three main strengths.first examining three separate companies with randomized functional departments into intervention comparison conditions allowed strong comparative analysis.second data suggest that results valid abildgaard . sense that models provided good matched qualitative data.third parallel mixed methods evaluation design allows methodological triangulation strengthening results.specifically addition rounds questionnaire data substantial amount qualitative material provides methodologically strong basis mixed methods analysis allowing study provide details specific contexts they might have triggered mechanisms.though study considerable merit number limitations need mentioned.first relies self reported measures which necessary when assessing perceived phenomena such experiences with psychosocial work environment.using same method quantitative data collection leads risk common method bias podsakoff organ substantial time difference year between measurement points minimizes this risk podsakoff .additionally common method bias would theoretically have similar effect each group. assess differences between intervention control three different companies problem common method bias chosen design limited.second outcome measure awareness capability manage work environment developmental measure focusing perceived changes following example thiele schwarz thus possible control baseline levels. other measures collective efficacy transformational leadership were controlled baseline scores which increased validity results field .third relatively small sample size moderate response rate suggest that testing same mechanisms much larger sample might yield different results modest sample size instance meant that bootstrap testing mediation infeasible .however although this method limited study generalizability questionnaires were supplemented interviews observation data which provided comprehensive picture intervention.fourth three companies within industrial production sector employ similar types employee.although this allows comparison cases also limits generalizability results other sectors groups.fifth have taken clustered nature data into account using multiple groups structural equation models. other methods could have been used .mixed models described blanc . methods described muthén satorra implemented complex command mplus. mixed model approach deemed unsuitable because only have three workplaces approach yielded structural parameters that were similar those obtained from multiple groups analysis with confidence intervals that contained values from multiple groups analyses coefficients except .here difference modest change .sixth chosen mixed methods approach applies explanatory approach qualitative data which limits scope qualitative analysis focus organizational context hypothesized mechanisms.more explorative analyses also need conducted future more comprehensively illuminate complexities intervention processes.likewise could wish more alignment between quantitative qualitative analyses example that each path model assessed qualitatively.with nature qualitative data being diverse collected workshops that took part daily practice this possible could consider human relations diary study methods future studies alignment between data sources mixed methods achieved.conclusion this study shed light complex nature pois demonstrated such interventions studied using realist evaluation framework. focused different intervention mechanisms interacted with different contexts produce outcomes.that three companies markedly different contexts outcomes leads conclude that outcome intervention relied heavily context that this variation attributed intervention working through several different mechanisms that activated differently. urge researchers more closely assess which mechanisms likely activated from particular intervention examine context enables hinders triggering these mechanisms.funding author disclosed receipt following financial support research
