with popular belief that more ready individuals those with higher levels knowledge experience would better suited empowered sales manager than would less ready salespeople. surprising that findings actually demonstrate that exercises greater effect employees with lower knowledge experience. seen figures evident that enhances self efficacy adaptability salespeople with readiness whereas there effect salespeople with high levels readiness.from standpoint sales manager appears though there relatively little gain empowering salespeople with high levels experience knowledge. well that these people have enacted effective role will gain little from leader efforts.alternatively perhaps serve developmental function less experienced knowledgeable salespeople.kozlowski gully salas canon bowers have argued that functional leader behaviors most critical individuals teams still developing their roles organization.therefore although approached this work though would perceived more liberating than developmental perhaps these actions serve wider purpose than initially believed.certainly this remains question future research explore.managerial implications findings contradict theoretical work hersey blanchard which they suggested that employees high developmental stages ones most likely respond favorably empowerment like management.more recently over million customers purchased blanchard zigarmi zigarmi leadership minute manager increasing effectiveness through situational leadership which these authors reiterate that claim. present research suggests that fact those lower rather than higher levels development those best suited benefit from leader empowerment.this contradiction many obvious implications given that most textbooks areas both sales management well human resources present this proposed model fact.there several possible explanations this finding. example salespeople with greater experience knowledge already their ways example routinized their schedules workplace behaviors empowering them thus have little only marginal benefit.alternatively those with less experience knowledge seeking inspiration from their leaders embolden them encourage them make them feel their managers trust their ability things done their .these outcomes lead increase sales service satisfaction increased performance.hartline ferrell reported similar findings speculated that boundary spanning employees become more confident their abilities serve customers they become more proactive persistent.sujan . reported that individuals with higher levels self efficacy will forth greater effort. result this highly selfefficacious individuals better able handle difficulties inherent their jobs thereby leading greater performance. study also demonstrates that self efficacy increases adaptability above beyond direct effects leader empowerment.some general explanations this finding that salespeople often find themselves selling situations that specific figure .results hypothesized model. .avalues from linear effects model. .leadership empowerment behavior sales force customer. increase salesperson self efficacy increases belief being successful within selling situation.this feeling success allows salesperson more comfortable selling techniques that typically used. short confident salespeople will more willing innovate different approaches than will less confident people.this adaptability selling approach will then provide customer with greater level satisfaction because sales become more tailored aligned with customer particular needs wants.finally results study demonstrate importance sales service satisfaction effect performance area that received much discussion previously been underresearched.companies sales managers must committed engaging activities that will increase customers sales satisfaction level. avenue that sales managers need consider given potential improving sales service satisfaction.limitations future research although data used here were from multiple sources such overcome many biases found single source studies there several limitations that should noted.first having salespeople self report raises general concern that those salespeople with little experience fully understand whether sales manager current behaviors empowering. also possible that salespeople with longer experience have developed leadership substitutes fully realize when manager empowering them.second fact that perceptions self efficacy adaptability came from salespeople naturally raises concerns about influence method bias results podsakoff mackenzie podsakoff .whereas method bias have inflated magnitudes linear effects that were observed primary hypotheses focused interactive effects.evans conducted extensive monte carlo study regarding whether method variance might generate artifactual interactions concluded that results clear .artifactual interactions cannot created true interactions attenuated . .this combination with fact that customer satisfaction sales performance were measured from separate sources suggests that primary findings overly susceptible method effects.another limitation relates additional potential mediators self efficacy influences.whereas found support adaptability mediator influence self efficacy customer satisfaction thereby performance most certainly other intervening variables operative well. other words direct effect self efficacy performance likely mediated factors such amount effort expended salespeople well their persistence face challenges.although exclusion such variables likely confound present findings including them future research would help illuminate underlying processes linking self efficacy with important outcomes.given critical linking role that selfefficacy plays leader empowerment employee readiness interaction this looks ripe area future research. should that efficacy measure less reliable than would have preferred some scale development work this area warranted well.this work suggests several other potentially fruitful directions future research. example model exhaustive considering possible antecedents self efficacy adaptability.future research further expand scope potential antecedents such influence teammates technology competitive sales environment forth.also study should replicated within other industries organizations order further examine generalizability results.further findings focused role dyadic leader member relationships.whether these findings hold average leaderbehavior member reactions relationships open question.finally additional research that helps develop employee readiness examine effects other constructs would worthwhile. example suspect that there important personality attributes such openness experience that predispose people welcome empowerment. cognitive ability well play role terms enabling sales representatives thrive empowered setting dunning johnson ehrlinger kruger .moreover research that examines whether employee readiness construct similar interactions figure .moderating effect employee readiness self efficacy.. average.figure .moderating effect employee readiness adaptability.. average. ahearne mathieu rapp with employee training does with would strong contribution literature. hope that research provides foundation which future research efforts build order

with popular belief that more ready individuals those with higher levels knowledge experience would better suited empowered sales manager than would less ready salespeople. surprising that findings actually demonstrate that exercises greater effect employees with lower knowledge experience. seen figures evident that enhances self efficacy adaptability salespeople with readiness whereas there effect salespeople with high levels readiness.from standpoint sales manager appears though there relatively little gain empowering salespeople with high levels experience knowledge. well that these people have enacted effective role will gain little from leader efforts.alternatively perhaps serve developmental function less experienced knowledgeable salespeople.kozlowski gully salas canon bowers have argued that functional leader behaviors most critical individuals teams still developing their roles organization.therefore although approached this work though would perceived more liberating than developmental perhaps these actions serve wider purpose than initially believed.certainly this remains question future explore.managerial implications findings contradict theoretical work hersey blanchard which they suggested that employees high developmental stages ones most likely respond favorably empowerment like management.more recently over million customers purchased blanchard zigarmi zigarmi leadership minute manager increasing effectiveness through situational leadership which these authors reiterate that claim. present suggests that fact those lower rather than higher levels development those best suited benefit from leader empowerment.this contradiction many obvious implications given that most textbooks areas both sales management well human resources present this proposed model fact.there several possible explanations this finding. example salespeople with greater experience knowledge already their ways example routinized their schedules workplace behaviors empowering them thus have little only marginal benefit.alternatively those with less experience knowledge seeking inspiration from their leaders embolden them encourage them make them feel their managers trust their ability things done their .these outcomes lead increase sales service satisfaction increased performance.hartline ferrell reported similar findings speculated that boundary spanning employees become more confident their abilities serve customers they become more proactive persistent.sujan . reported that individuals with higher levels self efficacy will forth greater effort. result this highly selfefficacious individuals better able handle difficulties inherent their jobs thereby leading greater performance. study also demonstrates that self efficacy increases adaptability above beyond direct effects leader empowerment.some general explanations this finding that salespeople often find themselves selling situations that specific figure .results hypothesized model. .avalues from linear effects model. .leadership empowerment behavior sales force customer. increase salesperson self efficacy increases belief being successful within selling situation.this feeling success allows salesperson more comfortable selling techniques that typically used. short confident salespeople will more willing innovate different approaches than will less confident people.this adaptability selling approach will then provide customer with greater level satisfaction because sales become more tailored aligned with customer particular needs wants.finally results study demonstrate importance sales service satisfaction effect performance area that received much discussion previously been underresearched.companies sales managers must committed engaging activities that will increase customers sales satisfaction level. avenue that sales managers need consider given potential improving sales service satisfaction.limitations future although data used here were from multiple sources such overcome many biases found single source studies there several limitations that should noted.first having salespeople self report raises general concern that those salespeople with little experience fully understand whether sales manager current behaviors empowering. also possible that salespeople with longer experience have developed leadership substitutes fully realize when manager empowering them.second fact that perceptions self efficacy adaptability came from salespeople naturally raises concerns about influence method bias results podsakoff mackenzie podsakoff .whereas method bias have inflated magnitudes linear effects that were observed primary hypotheses focused interactive effects.evans conducted extensive monte carlo study regarding whether method variance might generate artifactual interactions concluded that results clear .artifactual interactions cannot created true interactions attenuated . .this combination with fact that customer satisfaction sales performance were measured from separate sources suggests that primary findings overly susceptible method effects.another limitation relates additional potential mediators self efficacy influences.whereas found support adaptability mediator influence self efficacy customer satisfaction thereby performance most certainly other intervening variables operative well. other words direct effect self efficacy performance likely mediated factors such amount effort expended salespeople well their persistence face challenges.although exclusion such variables likely confound present findings including them future would help illuminate underlying processes linking self efficacy with important outcomes.given critical linking role that selfefficacy plays leader empowerment employee readiness interaction this looks ripe area future . should that efficacy measure less reliable than would have preferred some scale development work this area warranted well.this work suggests several other potentially fruitful directions future . example model exhaustive considering possible antecedents self efficacy adaptability.future further expand scope potential antecedents such influence teammates technology competitive sales environment forth.also study should replicated within other industries organizations order further examine generalizability results.further findings focused role dyadic leader member relationships.whether these findings hold average leaderbehavior member reactions relationships open question.finally additional that helps develop employee readiness examine effects other constructs would worthwhile. example suspect that there important personality attributes such openness experience that predispose people welcome empowerment. cognitive ability well play role terms enabling sales representatives thrive empowered setting dunning johnson ehrlinger kruger .moreover that examines whether employee readiness construct similar interactions
