eisenhardt, 1989; jen-\\nsen & meckling, 1976) and may even have personal preferences\\nmore aligned with the opposing group. this may lead the represen-\\ntative to negotiate agreements that benefit him- or herself at the\\nll rights reserved.\\n\\namsterdam, department of\\ne netherlands.\\n.\\n\\nexpense of the group he or she represents (bazerman, neale, val-\\nley, zajac, & kim, 1992;

druck-\\nman, 2004; steinel, de dreu, ouwehand, & ramírez-marín, 2009;\\nsteinel et al., 2010; trötschel, hüffmeier, & loschelder, 2010; van\\nkleef, steinel, van knippenberg, hogg, & svensson, 2007). in two\\nexperiments we examine how representative negotiation behavior\\nvaries as a function of interest alignment between the representa-\\ntive, the constituency represented, and the opposing negotiator\\n(henceforth: adversary). importantly, we investigate whether rep-\\nresentatives’ willingness to sacrifice their self-interest to benefit\\ntheir constituency is contingent upon their interpersonal motiva-\\ntion. we argue and show that individuals with a natural tendency\\nto act pro-socially will be more willing than those with a pro-self\\nmotivation to sacrifice their self-interest to benefit their constitu-\\nency and to compete against the other group.\\nthe principal–agent problem and interdependence theory\\n\\nthe principal–agent problem refers to the situation in which the\\nagent or representative has, or may have, interests misaligned with\\nthose of the principal or constituency he or she is supposed to\\nserve. this misalignment of interests creates a problem for the\\nprincipal or constituency who delegates its decision control to an\\nagent that may be more or less trustworthy. this problem has\\n\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.06.001\\nmailto:h.aaldering@uva.nl\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.06.001\\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/07495978\\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/obhdp\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250 241\\ninspired a large number of studies testing possible means to ensure\\nthat representatives act in the interests of the group or organiza-\\ntion they represent (for reviews, see dalton, hitt, certo, & dalton,\\n2007; devers, canella, reilly, & yoder, 2007). much of this work\\nhas focused on monitoring the representative’s behavior or using\\nincentives to align self-interest with the interests of the repre-\\nsented constituency (allcock & filatotchev, 2010; bottom, hollo-\\nway, miller, mislin, & whitford, 2006; hunton, mauldin, &\\nwheeler, 2008; mclean parks & conlon, 1995). however, monitor-\\ning can be both expensive and logistically impractical, and incen-\\ntives do not always have the intended effects (bottom et al.,\\n2006; eisenhardt, 1989; mulder, van dijk, de cremer, & wilke,\\n2006; o’reilly & main, 2010).\\n\\none reason underlying the failure to adequately design incen-\\ntive and/or monitoring systems is that we still have a rather poor\\nunderstanding of when and why representatives sacrifice their\\nself-interests to benefit their constituency. the current study was\\ndesigned to fill this void. in contrast to much of the work on the\\nprincipal–agent problem, which is based on the assumption that\\nagents will follow their self-interest whenever they have the\\nopportunity to do so (eisenhardt, 1989), a growing body of work\\nin social psychology, organizational sciences, and behavioral eco-\\nnomics shows that humans violate assumptions of rationality, sac-\\nrifice self-interest to help others, and are influenced by norms of\\nfairness and reciprocity (camerer & fehr, 2006; de dreu, 2010a;\\nhenrich et al., 2001; van lange, de cremer, van dijk, & van vugt,\\n2007). such tendencies can be understood in terms of interdepen-\\ndence theory (kelley & thibaut, 1978; rusbult & van lange, 2003),\\nwhich holds that individuals (i) transform the objective interde-\\npendence structure between themselves and one or more others\\n(the ‘‘given matrix’’) into a subjective structure (the ‘‘effective ma-\\ntrix’’), and (ii) behave according to the effective matrix more than\\naccording to the objective, given structure. such transformations\\nare driven by temporarily activated or chronically available social\\ngoals, or motivational orientations.\\n\\nalthough many different motivational orientations are conceiv-\\nable (e.g., mcclintock & liebrand, 1988; van lange et al., 2007),\\nmost research and theory on motivational orientation relies on\\nthe broad dichotomy between pro-self and pro-social orientations.\\nindividuals with a pro-self orientation often opt for non-coopera-\\ntion and only value high own outcomes, whereas those with a\\npro-social orientation have a desire for equality and reciprocity,\\ntend to initiate cooperation, and care for others (for reviews, see\\ne.g., de dreu, 2010a; mcclintock, 1977; van lange, 1999, 2000). in-\\ndeed, in distributive bargaining and negotiation where individuals\\nneed to strike a balance between their self-interests and those of\\ntheir adversary, the stronger desire for equality and fairness often\\nleads negotiators with a pro-social orientation to demand less and\\nconcede more than negotiators with a pro-self orientation (e.g.,\\nbeersma & de dreu, 1999; de dreu & van lange, 1995; gillespie,\\nweingart, & brett, 2000; olekalns & smith, 2003; schei & rognes,\\n2003; trötschel & gollwitzer, 2007).\\nsocial value orientation and interest (mis)alignment in\\nintergroup negotiations\\n\\nwhen negotiators represent a constituency, they need to take\\ninto account two additional types of interests – those of the con-\\nstituency they represent, and those of the overarching collective\\ncomprising both one’s own and the opposing group. in this com-\\nplex set of interdependencies, the representative’s self-interest\\nmay or may not be aligned with the interests of his constituency.\\nin fact, it is conceivable that constituencies’ and adversaries’ inter-\\nests are aligned, yet both are at odds with those of the representa-\\ntive. when, for example, both groups desire quick resolution of a\\ncostly conflict, yet their representatives are compensated on an\\nhourly basis, the representatives may be motivated to prolong\\nthe conflict and to slow down dispute resolution. along similar\\nlines, the representative’s self-interest may be quite compatible\\nwith the interests of the adversary, yet opposed to the representa-\\ntive’s constituency - as in the opening example of investment\\nbankers.\\n\\nthe fact that a representative’s self-interest, the interests of the\\nconstituency, and those of the adversary may be differentially\\naligned or misaligned should be relatively unimportant to repre-\\nsentatives with a pro-self orientation. after all, pro-selves focus\\non self-interest more than pro-socials. as representatives, they will\\nsacrifice their constituencies’ interests when these are misaligned\\nwith their self-interest, inasmuch as they will be tough with their\\nadversary when the adversary’s interests oppose their own. put\\ndifferently, we expected pro-self representatives to behave in line\\nwith agency theory, which assumes that representatives are dri-\\nven by self-interest and will serve their constituencies’ interests\\nonly when these converge with their self-interests (bazerman\\net al., 1992; eisenhardt, 1989; jensen & meckling, 1976; valley\\net al., 1992).\\n\\nfor pro-social representatives, matters are more complicated.\\npro-socials make large concessions and are relatively cooperative\\ntowards their adversary across different settings (e.g., de dreu &\\nboles, 1998; de dreu & van lange, 1995; giacomantonio, de dreu,\\nshalvi, sligte, & leder, 2010; van dijk, de cremer, & handgraaf,\\n2004). this suggests that pro-social representatives are willing to\\naccommodate the interests of the opposing group at a cost to\\nthemselves. however, past research has not considered how the\\ninterests of the representative’s constituency may interact with\\nthe representatives’ personal motives to determine their eventual\\nnegotiation behavior.\\n\\nhere we propose that pro-socials are more likely than pro-\\nselves to sacrifice their self-interest to benefit their adversary,\\nbut only if this benefits their constituency as well. in developing\\nthis idea, we draw on research on social dilemmas which shows\\nthat pro-socials make more self-costly contributions to common\\ngoods than pro-self individuals (for reviews, see au & kwong,\\n2004; balliet, parks, & joireman, 2009; bogaert, boone, & declerck,\\n2008; van lange, de cremer, van dijk, & van vugt, 2007). this\\nfinding holds across different experimental settings, using different\\nsocial dilemma games as well as across field settings. for example,\\npro-socials are more than pro-selves willing to engage in pro-envi-\\nronmental behavior such as signing petitions or contributing\\nmoney as well as to travel with public transport rather than by\\ncar (which is in the short term less convenient and flexible, but\\nin the long term better for the collective environment and health)\\n(bogaert et al., 2008). following the transformation-hypothesis in\\ninterdependence theory (kelley & thibaut, 1978), the reasoning\\nhere is that pro-self individuals define the social dilemma in terms\\nof individual rationality, leading them towards non-cooperation,\\nwhereas pro-social individuals define the dilemma in terms of col-\\nlective rationality, leading them towards cooperation (liebrand,\\n1984; van lange, liebrand, & kuhlman, 1990). indeed, increased\\nidentification with the collective does not affect pro-socials’ level\\nof self-sacrificing cooperation because they already focus on collec-\\ntive welfare, yet strongly increases cooperation among pro-selves\\n(e.g., de cremer & van dijk, 2002). thus, pro-socials’ tendency to\\naccommodate their adversary at a personal cost is driven by the\\nmotivation to serve the overarching collective of in-group and\\nout-group together, rather than the adversary and his or her con-\\nstituency only.\\n\\npro-social representatives would thus be most willing to sacri-\\nfice themselves when this benefits constituency as well as adver-\\nsary (the ‘collective’). however, a problem arises when there is\\nno collective and the different subgroups (constituency group\\n\\n\\n\\n242 h. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250\\nand adversary group) have divergent interests. cooperating with\\nthe adversary in this scenario implies sacrificing not only one’s\\nown, but also the constituents’ interests. pro-socials thus need to\\nchoose which subgroup to cooperate with: constituency or adver-\\nsary. research into so-called nested social dilemmas, in which indi-\\nviduals choose to benefit their sub-group and/or an overarching\\ncollective, shows that individuals are likely to sacrifice personal\\ninterests by contributing to the subgroup level (wit & kerr,\\n2002). however, when the salience of the overarching collective\\nis enhanced, self-sacrificial cooperation shifts from the subgroup\\nto the overarching collective level, thus benefitting both in-group\\nand out-group (polzer, stewart, & simmons, 1999; wit & kerr,\\n2002). relating these findings to the transformation hypothesis,\\nwhich holds that the collective level is more salient to pro-social\\nthan to pro-self individuals (bogaert et al., 2008; van lange et al.,\\n2007), we propose:\\n\\nhypothesis 1. pro-social representatives will make greater con-\\ncessions than pro-selves when concessions serve collective inter-\\nests (own constituency and adversary combined) and not when\\nconcessions serve the adversaries’ interests only.\\nexperiment 1\\n\\nto test hypothesis 1, we developed a new inter-group conflict\\ngame in which individuals negotiated on behalf of their constitu-\\nency with the representative of the adversary group. to allow for\\nthe most straightforward test of our hypothesis, the negotiation in-\\nvolved a single issue, where the representative’s self-interest was\\neither opposed to or aligned with the interests of the represented\\nconstituency, and always opposed to the adversary. concession\\nmaking towards the adversary thus always hurt the representa-\\ntive’s self-interest and always benefitted the adversary. depending\\non condition, concession making either benefitted or hurt the con-\\nstituencies’ interests. our hypothesis was that pro-self individuals\\nwould be relatively immune to such interest (mis)alignment, and\\nthat pro-social individuals would be more conciliatory towards\\nthe adversary, but only when this conciliatory behavior would ben-\\nefit their constituency as well. self-sacrificial concession making\\nwas operationalized in terms of (i) the first offer participants made,\\nwith higher (i.e., more generous) offers being more personally\\ncostly, and (ii) the number of rounds representatives took to reach\\nan agreement. because participants interacted with a pre-pro-\\ngrammed adversary who matched concessions (see below), fewer\\nrounds reflect greater self-sacrificial concession making by the\\nparticipant.\\n\\nmethod\\n\\nparticipants and design\\n\\nforty-eight undergraduate students from the university of\\namsterdam (mean age 22.58, sd = 5.45, 72% female) participated\\nfor course credit or €7. participants were randomly assigned to\\nthe interest alignment conditions of a 2 � 2 factorial with structure\\nof the negotiation task (interests opposed to adversary only or to\\nboth constituency and adversary) and social value orientation\\n(pro-social or pro-self) as the between-subject variables.\\n\\nprocedure and negotiation task\\n\\nupon arrival in the laboratory, participants were seated in indi-\\nvidual cubicles behind a computer. they read that they would fill\\nout some questionnaires and subsequently engage in a negotiation\\nbetween two groups, and that the groups would be formed based\\non two personality questionnaires. participants then proceeded\\nwith two questionnaires, one of which assessed their social value\\norientation.\\n\\nwe used the decomposed game measure (van lange & kuhl-\\nman, 1994), a measure that has good internal consistency (lie-\\nbrand & van run, 1985; parks, 1994), test–retest reliability\\n(eisenberger, kuhlman, & cotterell, 1992) and construct validity\\n(van lange, 1999). the measure was introduced as follows: ‘below\\nyou see nine decisions in which you have to make a choice. your\\nchoice influences the amount of points you and some other person\\nwill get. think of the points as something that is valuable to you, to\\nwhich you attach great importance. the other person also attaches\\ngreat importance to the points’. participants were subsequently\\nasked to make decisions in nine decomposed games. in each game,\\nthere were three options of point distributions between them-\\nselves and another person. each of the options represents a partic-\\nular social value orientation. an example is the choice between\\noption 1 (500 points for self and 500 points for other), option 2\\n(560 points for self and 300 for other) and option 3 (500 points\\nfor self and 100 for other). in this example, option 1 represents\\nthe pro-social orientation because it provides an equal distribution\\nof outcomes and the highest joint outcome (1000). option 2 repre-\\nsents the individualistic orientation because the own outcomes are\\nhigher (560) than in option 1 or 3 (500). option 3 represents the\\ncompetitive choice because it maximizes the differences between\\nown and other’s outcomes. (500 � 100 = 400 in option 3; whereas\\n500 � 500 = 0 in option 1 and 560 � 300 = 260 in option 2). partic-\\nipants were classified as pro-social, individualist or competitor if\\nthey made at least six choices consistent with one of the three ori-\\nentations. all participants were classifiable: 18 were classified as\\npro-social and 30 as individualists or competitors. because in the\\ncurrent context no differences in behavior were expected between\\nindividualists and competitors, these two groups were combined\\ninto one ‘pro-self’ category (van lange, 1999).\\n\\nafter completion of the second questionnaire, the need for cog-\\nnitive closure scale (webster & kruglanski, 1994), which served as\\na filler task, participants were told that based on their score on the\\nquestionnaires, they were a member of group o, which would\\nnegotiate against group p. participants were informed that the\\ncomputer would randomly determine who would represent the\\ngroups in the upcoming negotiation. in reality, each participant\\nwas assigned the role of representative of group o, and would\\nnegotiate with the unknown representative of group p. the adver-\\nsary representative was computer simulated. this type of minimal\\n(inter)-group paradigm is adapted from other past research on rep-\\nresentative negotiation (steinel et al., 2010; van kleef et al., 2007).\\n\\nthe negotiation consisted of one distributive issue, with thir-\\nteen levels of agreement, ranging from 0 to 36 points with increas-\\ning steps of three points per level. the representative would always\\nget the highest amount of points (36) for an agreement at level 1\\nand the lowest amount of points (0) for an agreement at level 13.\\nnext to their own individual point schedule, participants saw the\\npoint schedule of their constituency, group o. in the condition\\nwhere representatives’ interests were opposed to the adversary\\nonly, this schedule was exactly the same as the schedule of the par-\\nticipants. thus, in this condition concessions towards the adver-\\nsary equally hurt the participants’ self-interest as the interests of\\nhis or her constituency. in the condition where representatives’\\ninterests were opposed to both their constituency and the adver-\\nsary, the schedule of the constituency was the opposite: group o\\nwould get the most (36) points

condition where the representative’s interests were aligned\\nwith the constituency but opposed to the adversary contained 10\\npro-social and 17 pro-self participants. the condition where repre-\\nsentative’s interests were opposed to both constituency and adver-\\nsary consisted of 8 pro-social and 13 pro-self participants.\\n\\nto increase their motivation, participants were led to believe\\nthat the points represented real money, both for them and for\\nthe constituency and adversary, and that they could earn up to\\nan extra 7€ depending on their negotiation outcome. they were\\nalso told that their constituency would evaluate the agreement\\nthey would make and that failure to reach an agreement would re-\\nsult in no extra money for any participant (whether constituent,\\nrepresentative, or adversary). it was made clear that the constitu-\\nents had no insight in the point schedule of the representative\\nand the point schedule of the adversary from group p was never\\nshown. the adversary was simulated to make reciprocal offers\\ndepending on the offer of the participant, who initiated the nego-\\ntiation. this style was chosen due to its credibility to participants\\nand its neutrality in terms of competition or cooperation. a contin-\\ngent reciprocal style is a common tactic in bargaining and it is\\ntransparent and intelligible for the negotiation partner (axelrod,\\n1984; osgood, 1962; van lange & visser, 1999).\\n\\nthe adversary was programmed such that proposals for an\\nagreement on level 7 or higher would be accepted. when an agree-\\nment was reached or 10 min had passed, participants answered\\nmanipulation check questions, were debriefed, paid and dismissed.\\n\\ndependent variables\\n\\nthe main dependent variable was the extent to which partici-\\npants engaged in self-sacrificing cooperation towards the adver-\\nsary. main indicators were the first offer that representatives\\nmade with higher (i.e., more generous) first offers reflecting greater\\nself-sacrifice, and the number of rounds it took participants to\\nreach an agreement. because the simulated adversary reciprocated\\nparticipants’ offers, more rounds reflect smaller concessions to-\\nwards the adversary.\\n\\na manipulation check was included to verify whether partici-\\npants correctly perceived the structure of the negotiation differ-\\nently depending on interest alignment. this measure consisted of\\nfour items, an example being ‘my group and i had the same goals\\nduring the negotiation’ (1 = not at all to 7 = very much; cronbach’s\\na = .91).\\nresults\\n\\nmanipulation check\\n\\nanswers to the manipulation check were submitted to a 2\\n(structure: self-interest opposed to adversary only, or to both con-\\nstituency

between their self-interest and the interests of their\\nconstituency (m = 5.46, sd = 1.25) than participants whose self-\\ninterest was opposed to the adversary only (m = 2.07, sd = .96,\\nf(1,44) =

2.89 vs. m = 6.59,\\nsd = 3.83, f(1,44) = .36, p = .55, g2 = .008). these results support\\nhypothesis 1.\\ndiscussion\\n\\nthe results of experiment 1 indicate that pro-social representa-\\ntives’ cooperative behavior is limited to a situation where parties’\\ninterests are not aligned. pro-socials did not engage in more self-\\nsacrificing cooperative behavior than pro-self representatives\\nwhen doing so would benefit their adversary and harm their own\\ngroup. rather, pro-social representatives negotiated as competi-\\ntively as pro-selves when only their adversary benefitted from\\n\\n\\n\\n244 h. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250\\nconcessions. however, as predicted, when concessions benefitted\\nthe constituency as well, pro-social representatives conceded more\\nthan pro-self representatives. thus, even in a competitive negotia-\\ntion situation, pro-socials appear more willing than pro-selves to\\nself-sacrifice to benefit the adversary, provided this benefits their\\nconstituency as well.\\n\\nwhile our results offer an important first insight into the inter-\\naction between representative motives and the interest alignment\\nstructures of representative negotiations, there are several limita-\\ntions. first, and probably because of the relatively small sample\\nsize, the interaction effect for number of rounds was only margin-\\nally significant. second, the reciprocal strategy employed by the\\npreprogrammed adversary could have potentially influenced the\\nnumber of rounds it took representatives to reach an agreement.\\na competitive first offer by the representative would be recipro-\\ncated by a competitive offer from the adversary, thereby poten-\\ntially increasing the duration of the negotiation, while a\\ncooperative offer would be reciprocated by a cooperative offer,\\nincreasing the likelihood of a quick agreement. therefore, in this\\nsetting, first offers and number of rounds cannot be treated as en-\\ntirely independent measures of negotiation behavior.\\nexperiment 2\\n\\nexperiment 2 was designed, first of all, to remedy the limitations\\nnoted about experiment 1 – to examine the robustness of the effect\\nby testing the same contrasts with a larger sample size, and to\\nexamine whether the effects on number of rounds are not merely\\ndriven by the adversaries’ strategy. additionally, we adapted the\\nprocedure in experiment 2 to obtain a measure of agreement level\\nthat complements the focus on negotiation processes.\\n\\nexperiment 2 was designed also to test a possible qualification\\nof the findings obtained in experiment 1. the interest (mis)align-\\nment conditions used in the experiment not only differed in terms\\nof interest alignment between representative and constituency, but\\nalso between constituency and adversary. in the condition where\\nrepresentatives experienced misalignment with their constituency,\\nthe interdependence between constituency and adversary was\\ncooperative (i.e., a positive correlation). because pro-social individ-\\nuals are more likely to perceive cooperative outcome interdepen-\\ndence (batson, 1998; de dreu, 2007; van lange, 1999), their\\ntendency to concede to their adversary may reflect greater sensitiv-\\nity to this positive interdependence, which increases cooperation\\n(in the current setting, concession making towards the adversary).\\nalternatively, the observation that pro-socials self-sacrifice more\\nthan pro-selves when doing so benefits the collective may reflect\\ntheir desire to benefit their represented constituency and ‘‘accept’’\\nthat doing so also benefits the adversary group. put differently, in\\nexperiment 1, pro-social representatives’ unwillingness to self-sac-\\nrifice when doing so would benefit the adversary only may reflect\\n(i) unwillingness to sacrifice the self for the benefit of the adver-\\nsary, (ii) unwillingness to sacrifice the constituency for the benefit\\nof the adversary, or (iii) both. rather than promoting collective\\ninterests, pro-socials’ self-sacrifice may reflect a desire to defend\\nand promote the interests of the own constituency. it is conceivable\\nthat, compared to pro-selves, pro-social individuals have a stronger\\ntendency towards parochial altruism: the willingness to sacrifice\\noneself to benefit the own group, especially if this concurrently\\nhurts a competing other group (boyd & richerson, 2009; choi &\\nbowles, 2007; de dreu, 2010b; gintis, bowles, boyd, & fehr, 2003).\\n\\nthe possibility that instead of serving the overarching collec-\\ntive, pro-socials are particularly motivated to self-sacrifice when\\nthis serves their in-group resonates with several recent findings.\\nin an intergroup conflict game developed by halevy, bornstein,\\nand sagiv (2008), de dreu (2010b) examined the contributions of\\npro-socials vs. pro-selves to a ‘‘within-group’’ and a ‘‘between-\\ngroup’’ pool. while contributions were personally costly, they\\nwould benefit the in-group and, in the case of the between-group\\npool, hurt the out-group. results showed that pro-socials contrib-\\nuted more to the within-group pool (henceforth ‘‘in-group love’’),\\nand non-significantly less to the between-group pool (henceforth\\n‘‘out-group hate’’). de dreu interpreted this pattern of results as\\nshowing that pro-socials more than pro-selves were parochial\\naltruists—they cooperated but only to benefit their in-group and\\nnot the overarching collective. however, pro-socials did not exhibit\\nmore out-group hate, which would be expected from parochial\\naltruists. rather, there was a non-significant decline in out-group\\nhate among pro-socials. if this effect would have been significant,\\nit would have followed that pro-socials self-sacrifice to benefit\\nthe overarching collective (a finding that would fit the pattern\\nwe observed in experiment 1).\\n\\nother evidence for increased parochial altruism among pro-so-\\ncial individuals derives from a recent study by abbink, brandt, her-\\nmann, and orzen (2012). these authors assessed individual value\\norientations using a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma (with those\\nchoosing the cooperative alternative being categorized as pro-so-\\ncial), and then introduced participants to a contest between their\\nown and a rivaling four-person group for a given prize of 2000\\nmoney units, shared evenly among the members of the winning\\ngroup. to win the contest, individuals contributed out of their per-\\nsonal endowments to a common pool. results showed that espe-\\ncially pro-social individuals were inclined to contribute to the\\ncommon pool that enabled their group to win the contest. put dif-\\nferently, pro-socials - more than pro-selves – displayed parochial\\naltruism in intergroup conflict games.\\n\\nwhereas these studies by de dreu (2010b) and abbink et al.\\n(2012) suggest that especially pro-social individuals self-sacrifice\\nto benefit their in-group rather than the overarching collective, a\\nnumber of critical differences exist between the settings of those\\nstudies, and the representative negotiation setting examined here.\\nfirst, the experimental games used in earlier work on parochial\\naltruism are so-called coordination games, in which individuals\\nmake private decisions to self-sacrifice that are non-contingent\\nupon the decisions made by other in-group members and/or mem-\\nbers of the out-group. the outcomes in these situations thus result\\nfrom independent decision making. negotiation games are qualita-\\ntively different because opposing individuals move back-and-forth\\nuntil they reach a commonly acceptable agreement, which subse-\\nquently results in outcomes to both sides (for a discussion of the\\ndifferences between coordination and agreement games, see e.g.,\\nde dreu & carnevale, 2003). whether findings from coordination\\ngames involving independent decision making comfortably gener-\\nalize towards agreement games involving communication and\\njoint decision making remains to be seen.\\n\\nanother important difference between earlier work on paro-\\nchial altruism and the current negotiation context is that individ-\\nual representatives are to a larger extent tuned towards their\\nout-group protagonist with whom they seek some form of agree-\\nment. this incentivizes a cooperative approach, and may detract\\nfrom the implicit or explicit desire to serve the constituency, espe-\\ncially when representatives’ interests are opposed to their constit-\\nuency but aligned with the adversary. put differently, especially in\\nrepresentative negotiations the individual may capitalize more on\\nthe features and characteristics of his adversary and less on ten-\\ndencies towards parochial altruism. the current experiment inves-\\ntigates whether parochial altruism also emerges in such relatively\\nweak (i.e., more cooperative) settings and whether it is then exhib-\\nited especially by pro-social individuals.\\n\\ntaken together, experiment 1 showed that especially pro-social\\nrepresentatives made, at a cost to themselves, concessions that\\nbenefitted their in-group as well as their adversary’s group, which\\n\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250 245\\nis consistent with the well-established finding that pro-socials\\nmore than pro-selves self-sacrifice to benefit an overarching collec-\\ntive. however, recent studies on experimental games (abbink et al.,\\n2012, de dreu, 2010b) point towards the possibility that pro-so-\\ncials’ increased concession making could also reflect parochial\\naltruism—their enhanced willingness to self-sacrifice for the benefit\\nof their in-group (and accept the benefit to the rivaling out-group as\\n‘‘collateral damage’’). experiment 2 was designed to tease apart\\nthese two possible explanations for the pro-socials’ increased will-\\ningness to self-sacrifice. to the design of experiment 1 we added a\\ncondition in which the representative’s self-interest was aligned\\nwith that of the adversary, and opposed to that of the constituency.\\nparticipant concession making would now promote the constituen-\\ncies’ welfare, at a cost to both self-interest and the adversary\\ngroup’s interest. in experiment 2, we thus compare representative’s\\nconcession making when concessions are self-costly and (i) benefit\\nthe adversary and hurt the constituency, (ii) hurt the adversary and\\nbenefit the constituency, and (iii) benefit both adversary and con-\\nstituency. furthermore, we now measured representatives’ motives\\nfor their behavior to uncover whether their different self-sacrificing\\nbehavior can be explained by the motivation to serve their constit-\\nuencies’ interests, as is suggested by previous work on the discon-\\ntinuity effect and representative negotiations (aaldering & de\\ndreu, in press; steinel et al., 2009; wildschut & insko, 2007).\\nmethod\\n\\nsample and design\\n\\none hundred thirteen undergraduate students from the univer-\\nsity of amsterdam (mean age 22.20, sd = 4.55, 67.3% female) par-\\nticipated in exchange for course credit or €7. participants were\\nrandomly assigned to the interest alignment conditions of a 3 � 2\\nfactorial design with structure (interests opposed to adversary\\nonly, interests opposed to both constituency and adversary, or\\ninterests opposed to constituency only) and social value orienta-\\ntion (pro-social or pro-self) as between subjects independent vari-\\nables. main dependent variables were first offers, negotiation\\nrounds, and agreement level. based on their choices in the decom-\\nposed game measure, fifteen participants could not be classified as\\neither pro-social or pro-self. these participants were excluded\\nfrom the analyses, decreasing the number of cases to 98 (49 pro-\\nsocials and 49 pro-selves) in total.\\nprocedure, task, manipulations, and measures\\n\\nthe procedure and negotiation task were identical to the previ-\\nous experiment, with three exceptions. firstly, a condition was\\nadded in which the adversary group had the same preferences as\\nthe representative (both preferred an agreement on level 1), while\\nthe constituency (group o) preferred an agreement on level 13.\\nlarge concession making in this condition would reflect self-sacri-\\nficing directed towards the own constituency only.\\n\\nsecondly, the simulated adversary was no longer programmed\\nto use a reciprocal strategy. instead, the adversary now made linear\\nconcessions of one step per round away from its opening offer of 1,\\nirrespective of the concession made by the representative. as a re-\\nsult, the agreement reached is indicative of the participants’ self-\\nsacrifice, as higher agreement values reflect greater self-sacrifice\\nto benefit the constituency and/or adversary, depending on condi-\\ntion. this strategy was changed for two reasons. firstly, a recipro-\\ncal strategy would not be possible in the condition were interests\\nof representative and adversary are aligned: reciprocating a self-\\nserving offer would immediately end the negotiation. furthermore,\\nas previously discussed, the reciprocal strategy of the opponent\\ncould affect the number of rounds representatives needed to reach\\nan agreement via their first offers (competitive offers eliciting a\\ncompetitive reciprocal offer, thereby increasing the number of\\nrounds, and vice versa).\\n\\nthirdly, not the participant but the adversary now made the\\nopening offer. in the new condition in this experiment, in which\\nthe representatives’ interests were aligned with the other group\\nand not with the constituency, this offer was in line with the rep-\\nresentative’s self-interest. accepting such a tempting offer from\\nthe adversary would serve both own and adversaries’ interest yet\\nhurt those of the represented constituency. by changing which\\nparty made the first offer, we could ensure that participants under-\\nstood that the other party had preferences similar to themselves,\\nand thereby increase the temptation to accept such a personally\\nfavorable offer.\\n\\nthe number of pro-socials and pro-self participants were dis-\\ntributed as follows over the different conditions: the condition in\\nwhich representatives’ interests were aligned with their constitu-\\nency but opposed to the other group contained 13 pro-socials\\nand 17 pro-selves. the condition in which the interests of the rep-\\nresentatives were opposed to both parties comprised 15 pro-socials\\nand 17 pro-selves. finally, the condition where the interests of the\\nrepresentatives were aligned with the other party but opposed to\\nthe constituency contained 21 pro-socials and 15 pro-selves.\\ndependent variables\\n\\nas in experiment 1, the behavioral measures of self-sacrificing\\nbehavior included the size of the first offer by the representative\\n(which was now a counteroffer to the preprogrammed offer of 1\\nby the adversary) and the number of rounds it took the represen-\\ntative to reach an agreement. due to the change in strategy em-\\nployed by the pre-programmed negotiation adversary, we could\\nnow also use the final agreement level as a dependent variable.\\n\\nhigher first offers would again signal self-sacrifice from the part\\nof the representative. similarly, an agreement on a high level\\nwould be against the interests of the representative. finally, in\\nthe condition where the adversaries’ interests were opposed to\\nthose of the representative, a high number of rounds formed an\\nindication of tough concession making with the adversary. in the\\nnew condition where interests of the representative were opposed\\nto those of the constituency only, number of rounds should be\\ninterpreted differently: because interests of representative and\\nadversary were now aligned, a beneficial agreement for these par-\\nties could be reached quickly. a high number of negotiation rounds\\nbetween representative and adversary would thus indicate an\\nunwillingness to close such a beneficial agreement out of concern\\nfor the interests of the constituency.\\n\\nin an attempt to shed more light on the motives underlying rep-\\nresentatives’ behavior, we added a scale assessing representatives’\\nwillingness to serve their groups’ interests. this motive was as-\\nsessed with four items. an example item is ‘i tried to fulfill the\\nwishes of my group’. cronbach’s alpha of this scale was .96. the\\nsame manipulation check items as in experiment 1 were used to\\nverify the extent to which representatives experienced interest\\nmisalignment between themselves and their constituency during\\nthe negotiation (cronbach’s alpha = .88).\\nresults\\n\\nmanipulation check\\n\\na 3 (structure: interests

generous first offers (m = 5.90, sd = 3.22 vs. m = 2.83,\\nsd = 2.69, f(1,92) = 14.56, p < .001, g2 = .14) and negotiated an\\nagreement on a higher level (m = 6.35, sd = 2.18 vs. m = 3.98,\\nsd = 2.36, f(1,92) = 22.72, p < .001, g2 = .20). the 3 � 2 interaction\\nbetween social value orientation and interest alignment was sig-\\nnificant for number of rounds f(2,91) = 14.44, p = .000, g2 =

than\\noverall interaction effects, we proceeded with testing directional\\ncontrasts (rosenthal & rosnow, 1985). these replicated the find-\\nings of experiment 1. when representatives’ interests were op-\\nposed to those of both their constituency and the other group,\\npro-socials made more generous first offers than pro-selves\\n(m = 5.27, sd = 3.22 vs. m = 2.88, sd = 1.93, t(92) =

= �2.42,\\np = .01). pro-socials did not differ significantly from pro-selves\\nwhen their interests were aligned with their constituency and op-\\nposed to the other group in first offers (m = 4.54, sd = 3.26 vs.\\nm = 3.18, sd = 1.93, t(92) = �1.151, p = .250), number of rounds\\n(m = 4.77, sd = 1.36 vs. m = 5.35, sd = 1.58, t(92) = 1.350,\\np = .180), and final agreement (m = 6.15, sd = 3.36 vs. m = 4.53,\\nsd = 3.24, t(92) = �1.829, p = .07). their self-sacrificing behavior\\nwas thus directed to benefit both their constituency and the other\\ngroup, rather than to benefit the other group only, supporting\\nhypothesis 1. however, and as predicted in hypothesis 2, when\\nrepresentatives’ interests were opposed to those of their constitu-\\nency only, pro-socials made more generous first offers (m = 7.38,\\nsd = 2.80 vs. m = 3.67, sd = 3.86, t(92) = �3.44, p < .001), negoti-\\nated more rounds (m = 3.81, sd = .81 vs. m = 1.93, sd = 1.22,\\nt(92) = �4.76, p < .001), and reached higher (i.e., self-harming)\\nagreements (m = 5.95, sd = 1.60 vs. m = 2.60, sd = 2.26,\\nt(92) = �4.11, p < .001) than pro-selves: they sacrificed themselves\\nfor the benefit of their constituency, even when facing a strong\\ntemptation to do otherwise (see figs. 3–5).\\n\\nin line with our expectations, pro-socials engaged in even more\\nself-sacrificing behavior when this benefitted the constituency\\nonly compared to when it benefitted both the constituency and\\nthe adversary group. this is reflected in larger initial concession\\nmaking, demonstrated with more generous first offers\\n(t(92) = 1.96, p = .027). pro-selves on the other hand sacrificed their\\nconstituency to benefit themselves: when their interests were op-\\nposed to the constituencies’ interests only rather than to both con-\\nstituency and the other group, they negotiated fewer rounds\\n(t(92) = �7.42, p < .001) and reached a lower (i.e., more self-bene-\\nfitting) agreement (t(92) = �3.36, p < .001). the effect on first offers\\nwas not significant (t(92) = .694, p = .25).\\ntaken together, these findings provide support for hypothesis 2.\\npro-social representatives were especially likely to self-sacrifice to\\npromote the interests of their constituency only (as opposed to\\nbenefitting the overarching collective), while pro-selves neglected\\nthe interests of their constituency and

while motivation to serve the constituency\\nwas not related to the size of the first offers made by the represen-\\ntative (b = .308, se = .349, t(31) = .882, p = .385), motivation to\\nserve the constituency did predict the number of rounds it took\\nrepresentatives to reach an agreement (b = �.362, se = .117,\\nt(31) = �3.104, p = .004). a bootstrap analysis yielded a 95% confi-\\ndence interval ranging from .0014 to .4116, indicating that the\\nmediated effect on number of rounds was significantly different\\nfrom zero (1000 resamples).\\n\\nwhen interests of the representative were opposed to constitu-\\nency but in line with adversary, social value orientation was a sig-\\nnificant predictor of motivation to serve the constituency\\n(b = �.917, se = .269, t(35) = �3.407, p = .002), which in turn signif-\\nicantly predicted size of first offers (b = 1.341, se = .269,\\nt(35) = 4.981, p < .001) and number of rounds (b = .541, se = .090,\\nt(35) = 6.028, p < .001). we thus proceeded with bootstrapping\\nanalyses for both dependent variables (1000 resamples). the 95%\\nconfidence interval for first offers ranged from �2.14 to �.32, indi-\\ncating that the mediated effect was significantly different from\\nzero. for number of rounds, we obtained a 95% confidence interval\\nranging from �.66 to �.11, which also differed significantly from\\nzero. in sum, these findings largely support the idea that motiva-\\ntion to serve the constituency mediates the representatives’ self-\\nsacrificing behavior.\\ndiscussion\\n\\nthe results of experiment 2 support hypotheses 1 and 2. using\\na priori contrast analyses, we found that pro-social representatives\\nself-sacrificed more than pro-self representatives when doing so\\nserved the interests of both constituency and the other group\\nand, especially, when doing so served the interests of the constitu-\\nency only. additionally, we found representatives’ willingness to\\nserve their constituency to underlie their self-sacrificing behavior.\\nit fully explained the effect that pro-socials negotiated fewer\\nrounds than pro-selves when representatives’ interests were op-\\nposed to those of the constituency and the adversary, as well as\\nthe effect that pro-socials negotiated more rounds than pro-selves\\nwhen their interests were opposed to their constituency only.\\nhowever, it could only account for the higher first offer making\\nby pro-socials compared to pro-selves when representative’s inter-\\nests were opposed to those of their constituency and aligned with\\nthe adversary. taken together, these results are largely consistent\\nwith our argument that pro-socials are more concerned about their\\nconstituency than are pro-selves, and that pro-socials are more\\nwilling to sacrifice themselves to serve the constituency’s interests.\\n\\na somewhat surprising finding is that pro-social representatives\\nreached an agreement on a higher level (i.e., more favorable to the\\nconstituency) when their interests were opposed to both their\\nconstituency and the adversary group, rather than opposed to\\nthe constituency only. we attribute this to the paradigm we used.\\nwhen representatives’ interests are opposed to their constituency\\nonly, the range of concession making was, although not theoreti-\\ncally, practically smaller than when their interests opposed those\\nof the adversary group as well. the adversary group now did not\\nmake an offer that diverged strongly from representatives’ inter-\\nests, but instead had the same preferences as the representative:\\nto close a deal on a low level. although we found that representa-\\ntives made larger initial concessions, as reflected in higher first of-\\nfers when this benefitted their constituency only, this left them\\nwith a smaller range to negotiate compared to their relatively\\nlow self-benefitting first offer and the high counteroffer when their\\ninterests were opposed to those of the other group. because the\\nrange was relatively small, an agreement would inevitably be\\nreached on a level more favorable to both representative and\\nadversary. future research using a design that takes this into ac-\\ncount would provide stronger support for the conclusion that\\npro-socials are also parochial altruists in the final agreements they\\nmake.\\ngeneral discussion\\n\\nin intergroup competition and conflict, groups often engage a\\nrepresentative to negotiate on their behalf. in such negotiation sit-\\nuations, representatives’ interests are not always aligned with\\nthose of the constituency they represent. the current research\\nhighlights when and why representatives decide to sacrifice their\\nself-interest to benefit their constituency. across two studies we\\nfound that social value orientation interacted with interest align-\\nment to moderate representatives’ concession making. compared\\nto those with a pro-self orientation, pro-social representatives\\nwere more inclined to sacrifice their own interests to promote\\nthe interests of their constituency. experiment 2 showed that this\\ntendency was even stronger when pro-social representatives’\\ninterests were opposed to those of their constituency only, and\\ntheir self-interest was actually aligned with the interests of the\\nadversary group. in contrast, pro-self representatives’ behaved\\nselfishly regardless of their constituencies’ preferences – when\\ntheir interests opposed those of their constituency, they betrayed\\ntheir constituency when they had the opportunity to close a quick\\nand self-beneficial deal with the other party.\\ntheoretical implications\\n\\nthe current studies provide an extension and integration of sev-\\neral theories. firstly, the results show that pro-socials are not\\nindiscriminately cooperative. when interests of representative\\nand constituency were aligned, but opposed to the adversary nego-\\ntiation party, pro-social representatives did not engage in more\\nconciliatory behavior than pro-selves. this finding qualifies earlier\\nresults on interpersonal negotiation showing that in the ordinary\\nsituation where self-interest opposes adversary interests, pro-so-\\ncials make larger concessions than pro-selves (beersma & de dreu,\\n1999; de dreu & van lange, 1995; gillespie et al., 2000; olekalns &\\nsmith, 2003; schei & rognes, 2003; van dijk et al., 2004). this line\\nof research has not examined the influence of the presence of a\\nconstituency. conceding to the other group would in this situation\\nnot only imply sacrificing the self, but also sacrificing the constit-\\nuency. pro-social representatives were reluctant to engage in such\\nsacrificial behavior that would hurt not only themselves, but also\\ntheir constituency.\\n\\nit seems that pro-socials’ cooperative tendencies are geared to-\\nwards their constituency, while deliberately or inadvertently hurt-\\ning the other group. the tendency to engage in self-sacrificing\\nbehavior to promote one’s own group is an important motivator\\n\\n\\n\\n248 h. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250\\nof human behavior in conflict situations (e.g., halevy, weisel, &\\nbornstein, 2011; lowery, unzueta, knowles, & goff, 2006) and\\nthe behavioral pattern of pro-social representatives resembles\\nparochial altruism, an adaptive strategy in enduring inter-group\\nconflicts. an inter-group conflict is won by the group with the most\\nmembers willing to sacrifice themselves: self-sacrificing to benefit\\none’s own group often implies hostile behavior towards the com-\\npeting other group. parochial altruists thus have a competitive\\nadvantage in inter-group conflicts and as such contribute to the\\nsurvival of the group in the long run (arrow, 2007; boyd & richer-\\nson, 2009; choi & bowles, 2007; gintis et al., 2003). pro-social indi-\\nviduals may be especially susceptible to such self-sacrificing\\nbehavior because of their general inclination towards equality\\nand reciprocity. they reciprocate cooperativeness within the own\\ngroup, potentially leading to self-sacrificing behavior but at the\\nsame time strengthening the group. they also reciprocate compet-\\nitiveness when facing a competitive interaction partner (behav-\\nioral assimilation, kelley & stahelski, 1970; liebrand, jansen,\\nrijken, & suhre, 1986; parks & rumble, 2001; van lange, 1992)\\nand are as such not easily exploitable by hostile groups.\\n\\npro-selves seem to have evolved according to a different sur-\\nvival mechanism. although they are not willing to sacrifice them-\\nselves to benefit their own group, which may lead to disapproval\\nand eventually removal from this group, they also refrain from\\ndamaging the competing group, especially when this could poten-\\ntially incur personal losses: they always follow the strategy that\\nleads to highest personal benefit (balliet et al., 2009; de dreu,\\nweingart, & kwon, 2000; van lange et al., 2007). thus, within in-\\nter-group conflicts, pro-selves follow a strategy that is relatively\\nindifferent towards the other parties, and as such they manage to\\navoid personal losses in conflict escalation.\\n\\nour findings send an important message to agency theory (dal-\\nton et al., 2007; devers et al., 2007; eisenhardt, 1989), namely that\\nagents do not always pursue their self-interest. while pro-self rep-\\nresentatives behaved in accordance with agency theory, roughly\\n50% of the human population consists of people with a pro-social\\norientation (van lange, otten, de bruin, & joireman, 1997). we\\nfound this other half of the population to self-sacrifice for the ben-\\nefit of the own group, rather than to forsake their constituency to\\nbenefit themselves. as such, it appears that the principal–agent\\nproblem applies less to pro-social individuals, who are willing to\\nself-sacrifice to benefit the principals’ interests. pro-social agents\\nthus should be a good choice when one needs a representative\\nintrinsically motivated to serve the interests of the principal, rather\\nthan their own interests. a potential risk involved in such a deci-\\nsion is that pro-social representatives may be willing to hurt the\\ninterests of the other group, thus potentially worsening the conflict\\nand intergroup relations.\\navenues for future research\\n\\nthe present research provided a first step towards uncovering\\nthe dynamics that play a role in principal–agent-adversary interac-\\ntions, and we were able to develop a straightforward paradigm to\\ncleanly test our hypotheses. manipulating interest (mis)alignments\\nas done here allowed strong inferences about the motivations\\nunderlying the representative’s behavior. however, we studied a\\nnegotiation with one issue on which interests were inevitably op-\\nposed. many negotiations involve multiple issues, and different\\nparties may have opposing preferences on some, but aligned pref-\\nerences on other issues (de dreu, 2010a). such multiple issue\\nnegotiations allow for representatives to craft beneficial integra-\\ntive solutions for more than one party. specifically pro-social indi-\\nviduals have been shown to prefer high joint outcomes when\\npossible (stouten, de cremer, & van dijk, 2005; van beest, wilke,\\n& van dijk, 2003; van lange, 1999; van lange et al., 2007). how-\\never, the increased complexity of a situation where representative,\\nconstituency and adversary have diverging preferences on various\\nissues, poses a challenging situation for the representative to reach\\na win-win solution. as such, predicting and interpreting outcomes\\nreached in a complex negotiation setting with multiple issues and\\neven more diverging preferences would be difficult and less clean\\nthan results obtained in a distributive single issue negotiation task.\\nthe current design therefore allowed us to draw clear inferences\\nabout the motives of the representatives. future research should\\ninvestigate how representatives manage such complex negotiation\\nsituations and to what extent their social value orientation affects\\ntheir ability to reach a beneficial solution for each of the parties\\ninvolved.\\n\\nanother avenue for future research would be to increase the\\ncooperation level of pro-selves. the current studies show that\\npro-self representatives ignore their constituency and act only\\naccording to their self-interest. however, negotiation studies re-\\nvealed time and time again that pro-self individuals operate\\naccording to pro-social motives when they are instructed or re-\\nwarded to do so (e.g., de dreu et al., 2000). similarly, research on\\nsocial dilemmas and the goal transformation hypothesis has shown\\nthat pro-selves’ self-costly contribution level can be raised by\\nincreasing their identification with the group (e.g., de cremer &\\nvan dijk, 2002; de cremer, van knippenberg, van dijk, & van\\nleeuwen, 2008). in the current study, representatives were led to\\nbelieve they were part of a group based on a personality question-\\nnaire to induce some sense of identification with their constituents\\n(tajfel, 1970). this categorization was very minimal, and increas-\\ning the level of identification of the representative, for example\\nby increasing the relevance or salience of their group membership,\\nprovides fruitful ground for future research on (temporarily) alter-\\ning pro-selves’ self-interested motives.\\n\\nfinally, new work could investigate when and why pro-socials\\nbecome hostile and aggressive towards the adversary. in the cur-\\nrent research, we demonstrated that pro-social representatives\\nare not cooperative to their adversary if this is not beneficial for\\ntheir constituency. however, we cannot show the driving force be-\\nhind this parochial altruism: pro-socials could be mainly moti-\\nvated by a desire to promote their constituencies’ interests, to\\ndecrease the outcomes of the adversary (if these are negatively cor-\\nrelated with those of their constituency) or a combination of both.\\nthe findings of our experiments suggest that pro-socials are not\\nwilling to give up their constituency to hurt their adversary. if\\nthe adversary benefits from the same outcomes as their constitu-\\nency, pro-socials seem to accept this as collateral damage. it thus\\nseems more likely that their behavior is driven by a tendency to\\ndefend their in-group, which indeed emerged as an important\\nunderlying motive in experiment 2. even so, more research is re-\\nquired to investigate why pro-socials engage in parochial altruism,\\nand whether their defensive aggression towards the adversary is\\nrooted in fear of exploitation or in greed for better outcomes for\\nthe own group. especially the latter option is very counterintuitive\\ngiven the established literature on pro-socials’ preference for\\nequality and joint outcomes (de dreu et al., 2000; van dijk et al.,\\n2004; van lange, 1999; van lange et al., 2007). however, the pres-\\nence of a constituency to please and defend (perhaps in combina-\\ntion with the presence of a salient outgroup) may substantially\\nalter our current view on pro-socials’ benevolence by revealing\\ntheir potential dark side.\\nconclusion\\n\\nin conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the role of social\\nvalue orientation in a representative intergroup negotiation\\n\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. / organizational behavior and human decision processes 120 (2013) 240–250 249\\ndepends on interest

eisenhardt, 1989; jen-\\nsen & meckling, 1976) and may even have personal preferences\\nmore aligned with the opposing group. this may lead the represen-\\ntative to negotiate agreements that benefit him- or herself at the\\nll rights reserved.\\n\\namsterdam, department of\\ne netherlands.\\n.\\n\\nexpense of the group he or she represents (bazerman, neale, val-\\nley, zajac, & kim, 1992;

devers, canella, reilly, & yoder, 2007). much of this work\\nhas focused on monitoring the representative’s behavior or using\\nincentives to align self-interest with the interests of the repre-\\nsented constituency (allcock & filatotchev, 2010; bottom, hollo-\\nway, miller, mislin, & whitford, 2006; hunton, mauldin, &\\nwheeler, 2008; mclean parks & conlon, 1995). however, monitor-\\ning can be both expensive and logistically impractical, and incen-\\ntives do not always have the intended effects (bottom et al.,\\n2006; eisenhardt, 1989; mulder, van dijk, de cremer, & wilke,\\n2006; o’reilly & main, 2010).\\n\\none reason underlying the failure to adequately design incen-\\ntive and/or monitoring systems is that we still have a rather poor\\nunderstanding of when and why representatives sacrifice their\\nself-interests to benefit their constituency. the current study was\\ndesigned to fill this void. in contrast to much of the work on the\\nprincipal–agent problem, which is based on the assumption that\\nagents will follow their self-interest whenever they have the\\nopportunity to do so (eisenhardt, 1989), a growing body of work\\nin social psychology, organizational sciences, and behavioral eco-\\nnomics shows that humans violate assumptions of rationality, sac-\\nrifice self-interest to help others, and are influenced by norms of\\nfairness and reciprocity (camerer & fehr, 2006; de dreu, 2010a;\\nhenrich et al., 2001; van lange, de cremer, van dijk, & van vugt,\\n2007). such tendencies can be understood in terms of interdepen-\\ndence theory (kelley & thibaut, 1978; rusbult & van lange, 2003),\\nwhich holds that individuals (i) transform the objective interde-\\npendence structure between themselves and one or more others\\n(the ‘‘given matrix’’) into a subjective structure (the ‘‘effective ma-\\ntrix’’), and (ii) behave according to the effective matrix more than\\naccording to the objective, given structure. such transformations\\nare driven by temporarily activated or chronically available social\\ngoals, or motivational orientations.\\n\\nalthough many different motivational orientations are conceiv-\\nable (e.g., mcclintock & liebrand, 1988; van lange et al., 2007),\\nmost research and theory on motivational orientation relies on\\nthe broad dichotomy between pro-self and pro-social orientations.\\nindividuals with a pro-self orientation often opt for non-coopera-\\ntion and only value high own outcomes, whereas those with a\\npro-social orientation have a desire for equality and reciprocity,\\ntend to initiate cooperation, and care for others (for reviews, see\\ne.g., de dreu, 2010a; mcclintock, 1977; van lange, 1999, 2000). in-\\ndeed, in distributive bargaining and  where individuals\\nneed to strike a balance between their self-interests and those of\\ntheir adversary, the stronger desire for equality and fairness often\\nleads negotiators with a pro-social orientation to demand less and\\nconcede more than negotiators with a pro-self orientation (e.g.,\\nbeersma & de dreu, 1999; de dreu & van lange, 1995; gillespie,\\nweingart, & brett, 2000; olekalns & smith, 2003; schei & rognes,\\n2003; trötschel & gollwitzer, 2007).\\nsocial value orientation and interest (mis)alignment in\\nintergroup s\\n\\nwhen negotiators represent a constituency, they need to take\\ninto account two additional types of interests – those of the con-\\nstituency they represent, and those of the overarching collective\\ncomprising both one’s own and the opposing group. in this com-\\nplex set of interdependencies, the representative’s self-interest\\nmay or may not be aligned with the interests of his constituency.\\nin fact, it is conceivable that constituencies’ and adversaries’ inter-\\nests are aligned, yet both are at odds with those of the representa-\\ntive. when, for example, both groups desire quick resolution of a\\ncostly conflict, yet their representatives are compensated on an\\nhourly basis, the representatives may be motivated to prolong\\nthe conflict and to slow down dispute resolution. along similar\\nlines, the representative’s self-interest may be quite compatible\\nwith the interests of the adversary, yet opposed to the representa-\\ntive’s constituency - as in the opening example of investment\\nbankers.\\n\\nthe fact that a representative’s self-interest, the interests of the\\nconstituency, and those of the adversary may be differentially\\naligned or misaligned should be relatively unimportant to repre-\\nsentatives with a pro-self orientation. after all, pro-selves focus\\non self-interest more than pro-socials. as representatives, they will\\nsacrifice their constituencies’ interests when these are misaligned\\nwith their self-interest, inasmuch as they will be tough with their\\nadversary when the adversary’s interests oppose their own. put\\ndifferently, we expected pro-self representatives to behave in line\\nwith agency theory, which assumes that representatives are dri-\\nven by self-interest and will serve their constituencies’ interests\\nonly when these converge with their self-interests (bazerman\\net al., 1992; eisenhardt, 1989; jensen & meckling, 1976; valley\\net al., 1992).\\n\\nfor pro-social representatives, matters are more complicated.\\npro-socials make large concessions and are relatively cooperative\\ntowards their adversary across different settings (e.g., de dreu &\\nboles, 1998; de dreu & van lange, 1995; giacomantonio, de dreu,\\nshalvi, sligte, & leder, 2010; van dijk, de cremer, & handgraaf,\\n2004). this suggests that pro-social representatives are willing to\\naccommodate the interests of the opposing group at a cost to\\nthemselves. however, past research has not considered how the\\ninterests of the representative’s constituency may interact with\\nthe representatives’ personal motives to determine their eventual\\n behavior.\\n\\nhere we propose that pro-socials are more likely than pro-\\nselves to sacrifice their self-interest to benefit their adversary,\\nbut only if this benefits their constituency as well. in developing\\nthis idea, we draw on research on social dilemmas which shows\\nthat pro-socials make more self-costly contributions to common\\ngoods than pro-self individuals (for reviews, see au & kwong,\\n2004; balliet, parks, & joireman, 2009; bogaert, boone, & declerck,\\n2008; van lange, de cremer, van dijk, & van vugt, 2007). this\\nfinding holds across different experimental settings, using different\\nsocial dilemma games as well as across field settings. for example,\\npro-socials are more than pro-selves willing to engage in pro-envi-\\nronmental behavior such as signing petitions or contributing\\nmoney as well as to travel with public transport rather than by\\ncar (which is in the short term less convenient and flexible, but\\nin the long term better for the collective environment and health)\\n(bogaert et al., 2008). following the transformation-hypothesis in\\ninterdependence theory (kelley & thibaut, 1978), the reasoning\\nhere is that pro-self individuals define the social dilemma in terms\\nof individual rationality, leading them towards non-cooperation,\\nwhereas pro-social individuals define the dilemma in terms of col-\\nlective rationality, leading them towards cooperation (liebrand,\\n1984; van lange, liebrand, & kuhlman, 1990). indeed, increased\\nidentification with the collective does not affect pro-socials’ level\\nof self-sacrificing cooperation because they already focus on collec-\\ntive welfare, yet strongly increases cooperation among pro-selves\\n(e.g., de cremer & van dijk, 2002). thus, pro-socials’ tendency to\\naccommodate their adversary at a personal cost is driven by the\\nmotivation to serve the overarching collective of in-group and\\nout-group together, rather than the adversary and his or her con-\\nstituency only.\\n\\npro-social representatives would thus be most willing to sacri-\\nfice themselves when this benefits constituency as well as adver-\\nsary (the ‘collective’). however, a problem arises when there is\\nno collective and the different subgroups (constituency group\\n\\n\\n\\n242 h. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250\\nand adversary group) have divergent interests. cooperating with\\nthe adversary in this scenario implies sacrificing not only one’s\\nown, but also the constituents’ interests. pro-socials thus need to\\nchoose which subgroup to cooperate with: constituency or adver-\\nsary. research into so-called nested social dilemmas, in which indi-\\nviduals choose to benefit their sub-group and/or an overarching\\ncollective, shows that individuals are likely to sacrifice personal\\ninterests by contributing to the subgroup level (wit & kerr,\\n2002). however, when the salience of the overarching collective\\nis enhanced, self-sacrificial cooperation shifts from the subgroup\\nto the overarching collective level, thus benefitting both in-group\\nand out-group (polzer, stewart, & simmons, 1999; wit & kerr,\\n2002). relating these findings to the transformation hypothesis,\\nwhich holds that the collective level is more salient to pro-social\\nthan to pro-self individuals (bogaert et al., 2008; van lange et al.,\\n2007), we propose:\\n\\nhypothesis 1. pro-social representatives will make greater con-\\ncessions than pro-selves when concessions serve collective inter-\\nests (own constituency and adversary combined) and not when\\nconcessions serve the adversaries’ interests only.\\nexperiment 1\\n\\nto test hypothesis 1, we developed a new inter-group conflict\\ngame in which individuals negotiated on behalf of their constitu-\\nency with the representative of the adversary group. to allow for\\nthe most straightforward test of our hypothesis, the  in-\\nvolved a single issue, where the representative’s self-interest was\\neither opposed to or aligned with the interests of the represented\\nconstituency, and always opposed to the adversary. concession\\nmaking towards the adversary thus always hurt the representa-\\ntive’s self-interest and always benefitted the adversary. depending\\non condition, concession making either benefitted or hurt the con-\\nstituencies’ interests. our hypothesis was that pro-self individuals\\nwould be relatively immune to such interest (mis)alignment, and\\nthat pro-social individuals would be more conciliatory towards\\nthe adversary, but only when this conciliatory behavior would ben-\\nefit their constituency as well. self-sacrificial concession making\\nwas operationalized in terms of (i) the first offer participants made,\\nwith higher (i.e., more generous) offers being more personally\\ncostly, and (ii) the number of rounds representatives took to reach\\nan agreement. because participants interacted with a pre-pro-\\ngrammed adversary who matched concessions (see below), fewer\\nrounds reflect greater self-sacrificial concession making by the\\nparticipant.\\n\\nmethod\\n\\nparticipants and design\\n\\nforty-eight undergraduate students from the university of\\namsterdam (mean age 22.58, sd = 5.45, 72% female) participated\\nfor course credit or €7. participants were randomly assigned to\\nthe interest alignment conditions of a 2 � 2 factorial with structure\\nof the  task (interests opposed to adversary only or to\\nboth constituency and adversary) and social value orientation\\n(pro-social or pro-self) as the between-subject variables.\\n\\nprocedure and  task\\n\\nupon arrival in the laboratory, participants were seated in indi-\\nvidual cubicles behind a computer. they read that they would fill\\nout some questionnaires and subsequently engage in a \\nbetween two groups, and that the groups would be formed based\\non two personality questionnaires. participants then proceeded\\nwith two questionnaires, one of which assessed their social value\\norientation.\\n\\nwe used the decomposed game measure (van lange & kuhl-\\nman, 1994), a measure that has good internal consistency (lie-\\nbrand & van run, 1985; parks, 1994), test–retest reliability\\n(eisenberger, kuhlman, & cotterell, 1992) and construct validity\\n(van lange, 1999). the measure was introduced as follows: ‘below\\nyou see nine decisions in which you have to make a choice. your\\nchoice influences the amount of points you and some other person\\nwill get. think of the points as something that is valuable to you, to\\nwhich you attach great importance. the other person also attaches\\ngreat importance to the points’. participants were subsequently\\nasked to make decisions in nine decomposed games. in each game,\\nthere were three options of point distributions between them-\\nselves and another person. each of the options represents a partic-\\nular social value orientation. an example is the choice between\\noption 1 (500 points for self and 500 points for other), option 2\\n(560 points for self and 300 for other) and option 3 (500 points\\nfor self and 100 for other). in this example, option 1 represents\\nthe pro-social orientation because it provides an equal distribution\\nof outcomes and the highest joint outcome (1000). option 2 repre-\\nsents the individualistic orientation because the own outcomes are\\nhigher (560) than in option 1 or 3 (500). option 3 represents the\\ncompetitive choice because it maximizes the differences between\\nown and other’s outcomes. (500 � 100 = 400 in option 3; whereas\\n500 � 500 = 0 in option 1 and 560 � 300 = 260 in option 2). partic-\\nipants were classified as pro-social, individualist or competitor if\\nthey made at least six choices consistent with one of the three ori-\\nentations. all participants were classifiable: 18 were classified as\\npro-social and 30 as individualists or competitors. because in the\\ncurrent context no differences in behavior were expected between\\nindividualists and competitors, these two groups were combined\\ninto one ‘pro-self’ category (van lange, 1999).\\n\\nafter completion of the second questionnaire, the need for cog-\\nnitive closure scale (webster & kruglanski, 1994), which served as\\na filler task, participants were told that based on their score on the\\nquestionnaires, they were a member of group o, which would\\nnegotiate against group p. participants were informed that the\\ncomputer would randomly determine who would represent the\\ngroups in the upcoming . in reality, each participant\\nwas assigned the role of representative of group o, and would\\nnegotiate with the unknown representative of group p. the adver-\\nsary representative was computer simulated. this type of minimal\\n(inter)-group paradigm is adapted from other past research on rep-\\nresentative  (steinel et al., 2010; van kleef et al., 2007).\\n\\nthe  consisted of one distributive issue, with thir-\\nteen levels of agreement, ranging from 0 to 36 points with increas-\\ning steps of three points per level. the representative would always\\nget the highest amount of points (36) for an agreement at level 1\\nand the lowest amount of points (0) for an agreement at level 13.\\nnext to their own individual point schedule, participants saw the\\npoint schedule of their constituency, group o. in the condition\\nwhere representatives’ interests were opposed to the adversary\\nonly, this schedule was exactly the same as the schedule of the par-\\nticipants. thus, in this condition concessions towards the adver-\\nsary equally hurt the participants’ self-interest as the interests of\\nhis or her constituency. in the condition where representatives’\\ninterests were opposed to both their constituency and the adver-\\nsary, the schedule of the constituency was the opposite: group o\\nwould get the most (36) points for an agreement on level 13, and\\nthe least (0) points for an agreement on level 1. this difference\\nin point schedules created misalignment of interests between the\\nrepresentative and his constituency: concessions towards the\\nadversary would still hurt the participants’ self-interest yet benefit\\nthe interests of the constituency.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\nopposed to adversary \\nonly\\n\\nopposed to both\\n\\nfi\\nrs\\n\\nt

that failure to reach an agreement would re-\\nsult in no extra money for any participant (whether constituent,\\nrepresentative, or adversary). it was made clear that the constitu-\\nents had no insight in the point schedule of the representative\\nand the point schedule of the adversary from group p was never\\nshown. the adversary was simulated to make reciprocal offers\\ndepending on the offer of the participant, who initiated the nego-\\ntiation. this style was chosen due to its credibility to participants\\nand its neutrality in terms of competition or cooperation. a contin-\\ngent reciprocal style is a common tactic in bargaining and it is\\ntransparent and intelligible for the  partner (axelrod,\\n1984; osgood, 1962; van lange & visser, 1999).\\n\\nthe adversary was programmed such that proposals for an\\nagreement on level 7 or higher would be accepted. when an agree-\\nment was reached or 10 min had passed, participants answered\\nmanipulation check questions, were debriefed, paid and dismissed.\\n\\ndependent variables\\n\\nthe main dependent variable was the extent to which partici-\\npants engaged in self-sacrificing cooperation towards the adver-\\nsary. main indicators were the first offer that representatives\\nmade with higher (i.e., more generous) first offers reflecting greater\\nself-sacrifice, and the number of rounds it took participants to\\nreach an agreement. because the simulated adversary reciprocated\\nparticipants’ offers, more rounds reflect smaller concessions to-\\nwards the adversary.\\n\\na manipulation check was included to verify whether partici-\\npants correctly perceived the structure of the  differ-\\nently depending on interest alignment. this measure consisted of\\nfour items, an example being ‘my group and i had the same goals\\nduring the ’ (1 = not at all to 7 = very much; cronbach’s\\na = .91).\\nresults\\n\\nmanipulation check\\n\\nanswers to the manipulation check were submitted to a 2\\n(structure: self-interest opposed to adversary only, or to both con-\\nstituency and adversary) � 2 (social value orientation: pro-social\\nor pro-self) anova. participants whose interests were opposed\\nto both constituency and adversary perceived more interest mis-\\nalignment between their self-interest and the interests of their\\nconstituency (m = 5.46, sd = 1.25) than participants whose self-\\ninterest was opposed to the adversary only (m = 2.07, sd = .96,\\nf(1,44) = 115.59, p < .001, g2 = .72). no other effects were signifi-\\ncant. the manipulation was considered successful.\\n\\n behavior\\n\\nfirst offers and number of rounds were submitted to a 2 (struc-\\nture: self-interest opposed to adversary only, or to both group-\\ns) � 2 (social value orientation: pro-social or pro-self) manova.\\neffects for social value orientation showed that pro-socials made\\nmore generous first offers (m = 3.78, sd = 2.34 vs. m = 2.20,\\nsd = 1.79, f(1,44) = 6.46, p = .015, g2 = .13) and negotiated fewer\\nrounds (m = 4.28, sd = 2.65 vs. m = 7.20, sd = 4.34, f(1,44) = 6.48,\\np = .015, g2 = .13) than pro-selves. we also obtained an interaction\\nbetween social value orientation and interest alignment for first of-\\nfers (f(1,44) = 4.769, p = .034, g2 = .098) and a marginal interaction\\nfor the number of rounds (f(1,44) = 2.870, p = .097, g2 = .061).\\nfigs. 1 and 2 show the nature of these interactions. only when rep-\\nresentatives’ interests opposed those of their constituency did pro-\\nsocials engage in more cooperative behavior than pro-selves: they\\nmade more generous first offers (m = 4.80, sd = 2.04 vs. m = 2.08,\\nsd = 1.55, f(1,44) = 11.38, p = .002, g2 = .21) and negotiated fewer\\nrounds (m = 3.20, sd = 1.99 vs. m = 8.00, sd = 4.98, f(1,44) = 9.16,\\np = .004, g2 = .17). when self-sacrifice benefitted the adversary\\nonly, pro-socials did not differ from pro-selves in first offers\\n(m = 2.50, sd = 2.14 vs. m = 2.29, sd = 1.99, f(1,44) = 0.63, p = .80,\\ng2 = .001) and number of rounds (m = 5.63, sd = 2.89 vs. m = 6.59,\\nsd = 3.83, f(1,44) = .36, p = .55, g2 = .008). these results support\\nhypothesis 1.\\ndiscussion\\n\\nthe results of experiment 1 indicate that pro-social representa-\\ntives’ cooperative behavior is limited to a situation where parties’\\ninterests are not aligned. pro-socials did not engage in more self-\\nsacrificing cooperative behavior than pro-self representatives\\nwhen doing so would benefit their adversary and harm their own\\ngroup. rather, pro-social representatives negotiated as competi-\\ntively as pro-selves when only their adversary benefitted from\\n\\n\\n\\n244 h. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250\\nconcessions. however, as predicted, when concessions benefitted\\nthe constituency as well, pro-social representatives conceded more\\nthan pro-self representatives. thus, even in a competitive negotia-\\ntion situation, pro-socials appear more willing than pro-selves to\\nself-sacrifice to benefit the adversary, provided this benefits their\\nconstituency as well.\\n\\nwhile our results offer an important first insight into the inter-\\naction between representative motives and the interest alignment\\nstructures of representative s, there are several limita-\\ntions. first, and probably because of the relatively small sample\\nsize, the interaction effect for number of rounds was only margin-\\nally significant. second, the reciprocal strategy employed by the\\npreprogrammed adversary could have potentially influenced the\\nnumber of rounds it took representatives to reach an agreement.\\na competitive first offer by the representative would be recipro-\\ncated by a competitive offer from the adversary, thereby poten-\\ntially increasing the duration of the , while a\\ncooperative offer would be reciprocated by a cooperative offer,\\nincreasing the likelihood of a quick agreement. therefore, in this\\nsetting, first offers and number of rounds cannot be treated as en-\\ntirely independent measures of  behavior.\\nexperiment 2\\n\\nexperiment 2 was designed, first of all, to remedy the limitations\\nnoted about experiment 1 – to examine the robustness of the effect\\nby testing the same contrasts with a larger sample size, and to\\nexamine whether the effects on number of rounds are not merely\\ndriven by the adversaries’ strategy. additionally, we adapted the\\nprocedure in experiment 2 to obtain a measure of agreement level\\nthat complements the focus on  processes.\\n\\nexperiment 2 was designed also to test a possible qualification\\nof the findings obtained in experiment 1. the interest (mis)align-\\nment conditions used in the experiment not only differed in terms\\nof interest alignment between representative and constituency, but\\nalso between constituency and adversary. in the condition where\\nrepresentatives experienced misalignment with their constituency,\\nthe interdependence between constituency and adversary was\\ncooperative (i.e., a positive correlation). because pro-social individ-\\nuals are more likely to perceive cooperative outcome interdepen-\\ndence (batson, 1998; de dreu, 2007; van lange, 1999), their\\ntendency to concede to their adversary may reflect greater sensitiv-\\nity to this positive interdependence, which increases cooperation\\n(in the current setting, concession making towards the adversary).\\nalternatively, the observation that pro-socials self-sacrifice more\\nthan pro-selves when doing so benefits the collective may reflect\\ntheir desire to benefit their represented constituency and ‘‘accept’’\\nthat doing so also benefits the adversary group. put differently, in\\nexperiment 1, pro-social representatives’ unwillingness to self-sac-\\nrifice when doing so would benefit the adversary only may reflect\\n(i) unwillingness to sacrifice the self for the benefit of the adver-\\nsary, (ii) unwillingness to sacrifice the constituency for the benefit\\nof the adversary, or (iii) both. rather than promoting collective\\ninterests, pro-socials’ self-sacrifice may reflect a desire to defend\\nand promote the interests of the own constituency. it is conceivable\\nthat, compared to pro-selves, pro-social individuals have a stronger\\ntendency towards parochial altruism: the willingness to sacrifice\\noneself to benefit the own group, especially if this concurrently\\nhurts a competing other group (boyd & richerson, 2009; choi &\\nbowles, 2007; de dreu, 2010b; gintis, bowles, boyd, & fehr, 2003).\\n\\nthe possibility that instead of serving the overarching collec-\\ntive, pro-socials are particularly motivated to self-sacrifice when\\nthis serves their in-group resonates with several recent findings.\\nin an intergroup conflict game developed by halevy, bornstein,\\nand sagiv (2008), de dreu (2010b) examined the contributions of\\npro-socials vs. pro-selves to a ‘‘within-group’’ and a ‘‘between-\\ngroup’’ pool. while contributions were personally costly, they\\nwould benefit the in-group and, in the case of the between-group\\npool, hurt the out-group. results showed that pro-socials contrib-\\nuted more to the within-group pool (henceforth ‘‘in-group love’’),\\nand non-significantly less to the between-group pool (henceforth\\n‘‘out-group hate’’). de dreu interpreted this pattern of results as\\nshowing that pro-socials more than pro-selves were parochial\\naltruists—they cooperated but only to benefit their in-group and\\nnot the overarching collective. however, pro-socials did not exhibit\\nmore out-group hate, which would be expected from parochial\\naltruists. rather, there was a non-significant decline in out-group\\nhate among pro-socials. if this effect would have been significant,\\nit would have followed that pro-socials self-sacrifice to benefit\\nthe overarching collective (a finding that would fit the pattern\\nwe observed in experiment 1).\\n\\nother evidence for increased parochial altruism among pro-so-\\ncial individuals derives from a recent study by abbink, brandt, her-\\nmann, and orzen (2012). these authors assessed individual value\\norientations using a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma (with those\\nchoosing the cooperative alternative being categorized as pro-so-\\ncial), and then introduced participants to a contest between their\\nown and a rivaling four-person group for a given prize of 2000\\nmoney units, shared evenly among the members of the winning\\ngroup. to win the contest, individuals contributed out of their per-\\nsonal endowments to a common pool. results showed that espe-\\ncially pro-social individuals were inclined to contribute to the\\ncommon pool that enabled their group to win the contest. put dif-\\nferently, pro-socials - more than pro-selves – displayed parochial\\naltruism in intergroup conflict games.\\n\\nwhereas these studies by de dreu (2010b) and abbink et al.\\n(2012) suggest that especially pro-social individuals self-sacrifice\\nto benefit their in-group rather than the overarching collective, a\\nnumber of critical differences exist between the settings of those\\nstudies, and the representative  setting examined here.\\nfirst, the experimental games used in earlier work on parochial\\naltruism are so-called coordination games, in which individuals\\nmake private decisions to self-sacrifice that are non-contingent\\nupon the decisions made by other in-group members and/or mem-\\nbers of the out-group. the outcomes in these situations thus result\\nfrom independent decision making.  games are qualita-\\ntively different because opposing individuals move back-and-forth\\nuntil they reach a commonly acceptable agreement, which subse-\\nquently results in outcomes to both sides (for a discussion of the\\ndifferences between coordination and agreement games, see e.g.,\\nde dreu & carnevale, 2003). whether findings from coordination\\ngames involving independent decision making comfortably gener-\\nalize towards agreement games involving communication and\\njoint decision making remains to be seen.\\n\\nanother important difference between earlier work on paro-\\nchial altruism and the current  context is that individ-\\nual representatives are to a larger extent tuned towards their\\nout-group protagonist with whom they seek some form of agree-\\nment. this incentivizes a cooperative approach, and may detract\\nfrom the implicit or explicit desire to serve the constituency, espe-\\ncially when representatives’ interests are opposed to their constit-\\nuency but aligned with the adversary. put differently, especially in\\nrepresentative s the individual may capitalize more on\\nthe features and characteristics of his adversary and less on ten-\\ndencies towards parochial altruism. the current experiment inves-\\ntigates whether parochial altruism also emerges in such relatively\\nweak (i.e., more cooperative) settings and whether it is then exhib-\\nited especially by pro-social individuals.\\n\\ntaken together, experiment 1 showed that especially pro-social\\nrepresentatives made, at a cost to themselves, concessions that\\nbenefitted their in-group as well as their adversary’s group, which\\n\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250 245\\nis consistent with the well-established finding that pro-socials\\nmore than pro-selves self-sacrifice to benefit an overarching collec-\\ntive. however, recent studies on experimental games (abbink et al.,\\n2012, de dreu, 2010b) point towards the possibility that pro-so-\\ncials’ increased concession making could also reflect parochial\\naltruism—their enhanced willingness to self-sacrifice for the benefit\\nof their in-group (and accept the benefit to the rivaling out-group as\\n‘‘collateral damage’’). experiment 2 was designed to tease apart\\nthese two possible explanations for the pro-socials’ increased will-\\ningness to self-sacrifice. to the design of experiment 1 we added a\\ncondition in which the representative’s self-interest was aligned\\nwith that of the adversary, and opposed to that of the constituency.\\nparticipant concession making would now promote the constituen-\\ncies’ welfare, at a cost to both self-interest and the adversary\\ngroup’s interest. in experiment 2, we thus compare representative’s\\nconcession making when concessions are self-costly and (i) benefit\\nthe adversary and hurt the constituency, (ii) hurt the adversary and\\nbenefit the constituency, and (iii) benefit both adversary and con-\\nstituency. furthermore, we now measured representatives’ motives\\nfor their behavior to uncover whether their different self-sacrificing\\nbehavior can be explained by the motivation to serve their constit-\\nuencies’ interests, as is suggested by previous work on the discon-\\ntinuity effect and representative s (aaldering & de\\ndreu, in press; steinel et al., 2009; wildschut & insko, 2007).\\nmethod\\n\\nsample and design\\n\\none hundred thirteen undergraduate students from the univer-\\nsity of amsterdam (mean age 22.20, sd = 4.55, 67.3% female) par-\\nticipated in exchange for course credit or €7. participants were\\nrandomly assigned to the interest alignment conditions of a 3 � 2\\nfactorial design with structure (interests opposed to adversary\\nonly, interests opposed to both constituency and adversary, or\\ninterests opposed to constituency only) and social value orienta-\\ntion (pro-social or pro-self) as between subjects independent vari-\\nables. main dependent variables were first offers, \\nrounds, and agreement level. based on their choices in the decom-\\nposed game measure, fifteen participants could not be classified as\\neither pro-social or pro-self. these participants were excluded\\nfrom the analyses, decreasing the number of cases to 98 (49 pro-\\nsocials and 49 pro-selves) in total.\\nprocedure, task, manipulations, and measures\\n\\nthe procedure and  task were identical to the previ-\\nous experiment, with three exceptions. firstly, a condition was\\nadded in which the adversary group had the same preferences as\\nthe representative (both preferred an agreement on level 1), while\\nthe constituency (group o) preferred an agreement on level 13.\\nlarge concession making in this condition would reflect self-sacri-\\nficing directed towards the own constituency only.\\n\\nsecondly, the simulated adversary was no longer programmed\\nto use a reciprocal strategy. instead, the adversary now made linear\\nconcessions of one step per round away from its opening offer of 1,\\nirrespective of the concession made by the representative. as a re-\\nsult, the agreement reached is indicative of the participants’ self-\\nsacrifice, as higher agreement values reflect greater self-sacrifice\\nto benefit the constituency and/or adversary, depending on condi-\\ntion. this strategy was changed for two reasons. firstly, a recipro-\\ncal strategy would not be possible in the condition were interests\\nof representative and adversary are aligned: reciprocating a self-\\nserving offer would immediately end the . furthermore,\\nas previously discussed, the reciprocal strategy of the opponent\\ncould affect the number of rounds representatives needed to reach\\nan agreement via their first offers (competitive offers eliciting a\\ncompetitive reciprocal offer, thereby increasing the number of\\nrounds, and vice versa).\\n\\nthirdly, not the participant but the adversary now made the\\nopening offer. in the new condition in this experiment, in which\\nthe representatives’ interests were aligned with the other group\\nand not with the constituency, this offer was in line with the rep-\\nresentative’s self-interest. accepting such a tempting offer from\\nthe adversary would serve both own and adversaries’ interest yet\\nhurt those of the represented constituency. by changing which\\nparty made the first offer, we could ensure that participants under-\\nstood that the other party had preferences similar to themselves,\\nand thereby increase the temptation to accept such a personally\\nfavorable offer.\\n\\nthe number of pro-socials and pro-self participants were dis-\\ntributed as follows over the different conditions: the condition in\\nwhich representatives’ interests were aligned with their constitu-\\nency but opposed to the other group contained 13 pro-socials\\nand 17 pro-selves. the condition in which the interests of the rep-\\nresentatives were opposed to both parties comprised 15 pro-socials\\nand 17 pro-selves. finally, the condition where the interests of the\\nrepresentatives were aligned with the other party but opposed to\\nthe constituency contained 21 pro-socials and 15 pro-selves.\\ndependent variables\\n\\nas in experiment 1, the behavioral measures of self-sacrificing\\nbehavior included the size of the first offer by the representative\\n(which was now a counteroffer to the preprogrammed offer of 1\\nby the adversary) and the number of rounds it took the represen-\\ntative to reach an agreement. due to the change in strategy em-\\nployed by the pre-programmed  adversary, we could\\nnow also use the final agreement level as a dependent variable.\\n\\nhigher first offers would again signal self-sacrifice from the part\\nof the representative. similarly, an agreement on a high level\\nwould be against the interests of the representative. finally, in\\nthe condition where the adversaries’ interests were opposed to\\nthose of the representative, a high number of rounds formed an\\nindication of tough concession making with the adversary. in the\\nnew condition where interests of the representative were opposed\\nto those of the constituency only, number of rounds should be\\ninterpreted differently: because interests of representative and\\nadversary were now aligned, a beneficial agreement for these par-\\nties could be reached quickly. a high number of  rounds\\nbetween representative and adversary would thus indicate an\\nunwillingness to close such a beneficial agreement out of concern\\nfor the interests of the constituency.\\n\\nin an attempt to shed more light on the motives underlying rep-\\nresentatives’ behavior, we added a scale assessing representatives’\\nwillingness to serve their groups’ interests. this motive was as-\\nsessed with four items. an example item is ‘i tried to fulfill the\\nwishes of my group’. cronbach’s alpha of this scale was .96. the\\nsame manipulation check items as in experiment 1 were used to\\nverify the extent to which representatives experienced interest\\nmisalignment between themselves and their

the 3 � 2 interaction\\nbetween social value orientation and interest alignment was sig-\\nnificant for number of rounds f(2,91) = 14.44, p = .000, g2 = .24),\\nbut not for first offers (f(2,91) = 1.104, p = .336, g2 = .023), or\\nagreement level (f(2,91) = 1.142, p = .324, g2 = .024).\\n\\nbecause our hypotheses involved specific contrasts rather than\\noverall interaction effects, we proceeded with testing directional\\ncontrasts (rosenthal & rosnow, 1985). these replicated the find-\\nings of experiment 1. when representatives’ interests were op-\\nposed to those of both their constituency and the other group,\\npro-socials made more generous first offers than pro-selves\\n(m = 5.27, sd = 3.22 vs. m = 2.88, sd = 1.93, t(92) = �2.11,\\np = .019), negotiated fewer rounds (m = 4.07, sd = 1.10 vs.\\nm = 5.00, sd = .87, t(92) = 2.26, p = .013) and reached higher agree-\\nments (m = 7.53, sd = 1.99 vs. m = 5.47, sd = 1.81, t(92) = �2.42,\\np = .01). pro-socials did not differ significantly from pro-selves\\nwhen their interests were aligned with their constituency and op-\\nposed to the other group in first offers (m = 4.54, sd = 3.26 vs.\\nm = 3.18, sd = 1.93, t(92) = �1.151, p = .250), number of rounds\\n(m = 4.77, sd = 1.36 vs. m = 5.35, sd = 1.58, t(92) = 1.350,\\np = .180), and final agreement (m = 6.15, sd = 3.36 vs. m = 4.53,\\nsd = 3.24, t(92) = �1.829, p = .07). their self-sacrificing behavior\\nwas thus directed to benefit both their constituency and the other\\ngroup, rather than to benefit the other group only, supporting\\nhypothesis 1. however, and as predicted in hypothesis 2, when\\nrepresentatives’ interests were opposed to those of their constitu-\\nency only, pro-socials made more generous first offers (m = 7.38,\\nsd = 2.80 vs. m = 3.67, sd = 3.86, t(92) = �3.44, p < .001), negoti-\\nated more rounds (m = 3.81, sd = .81 vs. m = 1.93, sd = 1.22,\\nt(92) = �4.76, p < .001), and reached higher (i.e., self-harming)\\nagreements (m = 5.95, sd = 1.60 vs. m = 2.60, sd = 2.26,\\nt(92) = �4.11, p < .001) than pro-selves: they sacrificed themselves\\nfor the benefit of their constituency, even when facing a strong\\ntemptation to do otherwise (see figs. 3–5).\\n\\nin line with our expectations, pro-socials engaged in even more\\nself-sacrificing behavior when this benefitted the constituency\\nonly compared to when it benefitted both the constituency and\\nthe adversary group. this is reflected in larger initial concession\\nmaking, demonstrated with more generous first offers\\n(t(92) = 1.96, p = .027). pro-selves on the other hand sacrificed their\\nconstituency to benefit themselves: when their interests were op-\\nposed to the constituencies’ interests only rather than to both con-\\nstituency and the other group, they negotiated fewer rounds\\n(t(92) = �7.42, p < .001) and reached a lower (i.e., more self-bene-\\nfitting) agreement (t(92) = �3.36, p < .001). the effect on first offers\\nwas not significant (t(92) = .694, p = .25).\\ntaken together, these findings provide support for hypothesis 2.\\npro-social representatives were especially likely to self-sacrifice to\\npromote the interests of their constituency only (as opposed to\\nbenefitting the overarching collective), while pro-selves neglected\\nthe interests of their constituency and closed a personally favor-\\nable deal with the other

representative’s self-sacrificing behav-\\n\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250 247\\nior. we tested this using directional contrast analysis with social\\nvalue orientation as the between subjects factor. we found that\\npro-socials were more motivated to act in the interests of their\\nconstituency than pro-selves when their interests were opposed\\nto both their constituency and the adversary (m = 5.42, sd = .88\\nvs. m = 4.49, sd = 1.74, t(92) = �1, 963, p = .027), and even more\\nso when their interests were opposed to their constituency only\\n(m = 5.23, sd = 1.33 vs. m = 3.40, sd = 1.89, t(92) = �4.034,\\np < .001), but not when their interests were aligned with their con-\\nstituency (m = 5.56, sd = .90 vs. m = 6.16, sd = .80, t(92) = 1.224,\\np = .224).\\n\\nthese analyses were followed up by a test for mediation. in a\\nregression analysis, social value orientation was marginally related\\nto the motivation to serve the constituency when interests were\\nopposed to both constituency and adversary (b = .468, se = .251,\\nt(31) = �1.865, p = .07). while motivation to serve the constituency\\nwas not related to the size of the first offers made by the represen-\\ntative (b = .308, se = .349, t(31) = .882, p = .385), motivation to\\nserve the constituency did predict the number of rounds it took\\nrepresentatives to reach an agreement (b = �.362, se = .117,\\nt(31) = �3.104, p = .004). a bootstrap analysis yielded a 95% confi-\\ndence interval ranging from .0014 to .4116, indicating that the\\nmediated effect on number of rounds was significantly different\\nfrom zero (1000 resamples).\\n\\nwhen interests of the representative were opposed to constitu-\\nency but in line with adversary, social value orientation was a sig-\\nnificant predictor of motivation to serve the constituency\\n(b = �.917, se = .269, t(35) = �3.407, p = .002), which in turn signif-\\nicantly predicted size of first offers (b = 1.341, se = .269,\\nt(35) = 4.981, p < .001) and number of rounds (b = .541, se = .090,\\nt(35) = 6.028, p < .001). we thus proceeded with bootstrapping\\nanalyses for both dependent variables (1000 resamples). the 95%\\nconfidence interval for first offers ranged from �2.14 to �.32, indi-\\ncating that the mediated effect was significantly different from\\nzero. for number of rounds, we obtained a 95% confidence interval\\nranging from �.66 to �.11, which also differed significantly from\\nzero. in sum, these findings largely support the idea that motiva-\\ntion to serve the constituency mediates the representatives’ self-\\nsacrificing behavior.\\ndiscussion\\n\\nthe results of experiment 2 support hypotheses 1 and 2. using\\na priori contrast analyses, we found that pro-social representatives\\nself-sacrificed more than pro-self representatives when doing so\\nserved the interests of both constituency and the other group\\nand, especially, when doing so served the interests of the constitu-\\nency only. additionally, we found representatives’ willingness to\\nserve their constituency to underlie their self-sacrificing behavior.\\nit fully explained the effect that pro-socials negotiated fewer\\nrounds than pro-selves when representatives’ interests were op-\\nposed to those of the constituency and the adversary, as well as\\nthe effect that pro-socials negotiated more rounds than pro-selves\\nwhen their interests were opposed to their constituency only.\\nhowever, it could only account for the higher first offer making\\nby pro-socials compared to pro-selves when representative’s inter-\\nests were opposed to those of their constituency and aligned with\\nthe adversary. taken together, these results are largely consistent\\nwith our argument that pro-socials are more concerned about their\\nconstituency than are pro-selves, and that pro-socials are more\\nwilling to sacrifice themselves to serve the constituency’s interests.\\n\\na somewhat surprising finding is that pro-social representatives\\nreached an agreement on a higher level (i.e., more favorable to the\\nconstituency) when their interests were opposed to both their\\nconstituency and the adversary group, rather than opposed to\\nthe constituency only. we attribute this to the paradigm we used.\\nwhen representatives’ interests are opposed to their constituency\\nonly, the range of concession making was, although not theoreti-\\ncally, practically smaller than when their interests opposed those\\nof the adversary group as well. the adversary group now did not\\nmake an offer that diverged strongly from representatives’ inter-\\nests, but instead had the same preferences as the representative:\\nto close a deal on a low level. although we found that representa-\\ntives made larger initial concessions, as reflected in higher first of-\\nfers when this benefitted their constituency only, this left them\\nwith a smaller range to negotiate compared to their relatively\\nlow self-benefitting first offer and the high counteroffer when their\\ninterests were opposed to those of the other group. because the\\nrange was relatively small, an agreement would inevitably be\\nreached on a level more favorable to both representative and\\nadversary. future research using a design that takes this into ac-\\ncount would provide stronger support for the conclusion that\\npro-socials are also parochial altruists in the final agreements they\\nmake.\\ngeneral discussion\\n\\nin intergroup competition and conflict, groups often engage a\\nrepresentative to negotiate on their behalf. in such  sit-\\nuations, representatives’ interests are not always aligned with\\nthose of the constituency they represent. the current research\\nhighlights when and why representatives decide to sacrifice their\\nself-interest to benefit their constituency. across two studies we\\nfound that social value orientation interacted with interest align-\\nment to moderate representatives’ concession making. compared\\nto those with a pro-self orientation, pro-social representatives\\nwere more inclined to sacrifice their own interests to promote\\nthe interests of their constituency. experiment 2 showed that this\\ntendency was even stronger when pro-social representatives’\\ninterests were opposed to those of their constituency only, and\\ntheir self-interest was actually aligned with the interests of the\\nadversary group. in contrast, pro-self representatives’ behaved\\nselfishly regardless of their constituencies’ preferences – when\\ntheir interests opposed those of their constituency, they betrayed\\ntheir constituency when they had the opportunity to close a quick\\nand self-beneficial deal with the other party.\\ntheoretical implications\\n\\nthe current studies provide an extension and integration of sev-\\neral theories. firstly, the results show that pro-socials are not\\nindiscriminately cooperative. when interests of representative\\nand constituency were aligned, but opposed to the adversary nego-\\ntiation party, pro-social representatives did not engage in more\\nconciliatory behavior than pro-selves. this finding qualifies earlier\\nresults on interpersonal  showing that in the ordinary\\nsituation where self-interest opposes adversary interests, pro-so-\\ncials make larger concessions than pro-selves (beersma & de dreu,\\n1999; de dreu & van lange, 1995; gillespie et al., 2000; olekalns &\\nsmith, 2003; schei & rognes, 2003; van dijk et al., 2004). this line\\nof research has not examined the influence of the presence of a\\nconstituency. conceding to the other group would in this situation\\nnot only imply sacrificing the self, but also sacrificing the constit-\\nuency. pro-social representatives were reluctant to engage in such\\nsacrificial behavior that would hurt not only themselves, but also\\ntheir constituency.\\n\\nit seems that pro-socials’ cooperative tendencies are geared to-\\nwards their constituency, while deliberately or inadvertently hurt-\\ning the other group. the tendency to engage in self-sacrificing\\nbehavior to promote one’s own group is an important motivator\\n\\n\\n\\n248 h. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250\\nof human behavior in conflict situations (e.g., halevy, weisel, &\\nbornstein, 2011; lowery, unzueta, knowles, & goff, 2006) and\\nthe behavioral pattern of pro-social representatives resembles\\nparochial altruism, an adaptive strategy in enduring inter-group\\nconflicts. an inter-group conflict is won by the group with the most\\nmembers willing to sacrifice themselves: self-sacrificing to benefit\\none’s own group often implies hostile behavior towards the com-\\npeting other group. parochial altruists thus have a competitive\\nadvantage in inter-group conflicts and as such contribute to the\\nsurvival of the group in the long run (arrow, 2007; boyd & richer-\\nson, 2009; choi & bowles, 2007; gintis et al., 2003). pro-social indi-\\nviduals may be especially susceptible to such self-sacrificing\\nbehavior because of their general inclination towards equality\\nand reciprocity. they reciprocate cooperativeness within the own\\ngroup, potentially leading to self-sacrificing behavior but at the\\nsame time strengthening the group. they also reciprocate compet-\\nitiveness when facing a competitive interaction partner (behav-\\nioral assimilation, kelley & stahelski, 1970; liebrand, jansen,\\nrijken, & suhre, 1986; parks & rumble, 2001; van lange, 1992)\\nand are as such not easily exploitable by hostile groups.\\n\\npro-selves seem to have evolved according to a different sur-\\nvival mechanism. although they are not willing to sacrifice them-\\nselves to benefit their own group, which may lead to disapproval\\nand eventually removal from this group, they also refrain from\\ndamaging the competing group, especially when this could poten-\\ntially incur personal losses: they always follow the strategy that\\nleads to highest personal benefit (balliet et al., 2009; de dreu,\\nweingart, & kwon, 2000; van lange et al., 2007). thus, within in-\\nter-group conflicts, pro-selves follow a strategy that is relatively\\nindifferent towards the other parties, and as such they manage to\\navoid personal losses in conflict escalation.\\n\\nour findings send an important message to agency theory (dal-\\nton et al., 2007; devers et al., 2007; eisenhardt, 1989), namely that\\nagents do not always pursue their self-interest. while pro-self rep-\\nresentatives behaved in accordance with agency theory, roughly\\n50% of the human population consists of people with a pro-social\\norientation (van lange, otten, de bruin, & joireman, 1997). we\\nfound this other half of the population to self-sacrifice for the ben-\\nefit of the own group, rather than to forsake their constituency to\\nbenefit themselves. as such, it appears that the principal–agent\\nproblem applies less to pro-social individuals, who are willing to\\nself-sacrifice to benefit the principals’ interests. pro-social agents\\nthus should be a good choice when one needs a representative\\nintrinsically motivated to serve the interests of the principal, rather\\nthan their own interests. a potential risk involved in such a deci-\\nsion is that pro-social representatives may be willing to hurt the\\ninterests of the other group, thus potentially worsening the conflict\\nand intergroup relations.\\navenues for future research\\n\\nthe present research provided a first step towards uncovering\\nthe dynamics that play a role in principal–agent-adversary interac-\\ntions, and we were able to develop a straightforward paradigm to\\ncleanly test our hypotheses. manipulating interest (mis)alignments\\nas done here allowed strong inferences about the motivations\\nunderlying the representative’s behavior. however, we studied a\\n with one issue on which interests were inevitably op-\\nposed. many s involve multiple issues, and different\\nparties may have opposing preferences on some, but aligned pref-\\nerences on other issues (de dreu, 2010a). such multiple issue\\ns allow for representatives to craft beneficial integra-\\ntive solutions for more than one party. specifically pro-social indi-\\nviduals have been shown to prefer high joint outcomes when\\npossible (stouten, de cremer, & van dijk, 2005; van beest, wilke,\\n& van dijk, 2003; van lange, 1999; van lange et al., 2007). how-\\never, the increased complexity of a situation where representative,\\nconstituency and adversary have diverging preferences on various\\nissues, poses a challenging situation for the representative to reach\\na win-win solution. as such, predicting and interpreting outcomes\\nreached in a complex  setting with multiple issues and\\neven more diverging preferences would be difficult and less clean\\nthan results obtained in a distributive single issue  task.\\nthe current design therefore allowed us to draw clear inferences\\nabout the motives of the representatives. future research should\\ninvestigate how representatives manage such complex \\nsituations and to what extent their social value orientation affects\\ntheir ability to reach a beneficial solution for each of the parties\\ninvolved.\\n\\nanother avenue for future research would be to increase the\\ncooperation level of pro-selves. the current studies show that\\npro-self representatives ignore their constituency and act only\\naccording to their self-interest. however,  studies re-\\nvealed time and time again that pro-self individuals operate\\naccording to pro-social motives when they are instructed or re-\\nwarded to do so (e.g., de dreu et al., 2000). similarly, research on\\nsocial dilemmas and the goal transformation hypothesis has shown\\nthat pro-selves’ self-costly contribution level can be raised by\\nincreasing their identification with the group (e.g., de cremer &\\nvan dijk, 2002; de cremer, van knippenberg, van dijk, & van\\nleeuwen, 2008). in the current study, representatives were led to\\nbelieve they were part of a group based on a personality question-\\nnaire to induce some sense of identification with their constituents\\n(tajfel, 1970). this categorization was very minimal, and increas-\\ning the level of identification of the representative, for example\\nby increasing the relevance or salience of their group membership,\\nprovides fruitful ground for future research on (temporarily) alter-\\ning pro-selves’ self-interested motives.\\n\\nfinally, new work could investigate when and why pro-socials\\nbecome hostile and aggressive towards the adversary. in the cur-\\nrent research, we demonstrated that pro-social representatives\\nare not cooperative to their adversary if this is not beneficial for\\ntheir constituency. however, we cannot show the driving force be-\\nhind this parochial altruism: pro-socials could be mainly moti-\\nvated by a desire to promote their constituencies’ interests, to\\ndecrease the outcomes of the adversary (if these are negatively cor-\\nrelated with those of their constituency) or a combination of both.\\nthe findings of our experiments suggest that pro-socials are not\\nwilling to give up their constituency to hurt their adversary. if\\nthe adversary benefits from the same outcomes as their constitu-\\nency, pro-socials seem to accept this as collateral damage. it thus\\nseems more likely that their behavior is driven by a tendency to\\ndefend their in-group, which indeed emerged as an important\\nunderlying motive in experiment 2. even so, more research is re-\\nquired to investigate why pro-socials engage in parochial altruism,\\nand whether their defensive aggression towards the adversary is\\nrooted in fear of exploitation or in greed for better outcomes for\\nthe own group. especially the latter option is very counterintuitive\\ngiven the established literature on pro-socials’ preference for\\nequality and joint outcomes (de dreu et al., 2000; van dijk et al.,\\n2004; van lange, 1999; van lange et al., 2007). however, the pres-\\nence of a constituency to please and defend (perhaps in combina-\\ntion with the presence of a salient outgroup) may substantially\\nalter our current view on pro-socials’ benevolence by revealing\\ntheir potential dark side.\\nconclusion\\n\\nin conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the role of social\\nvalue orientation in a representative intergroup \\n\\n\\n\\nh. aaldering et al. /  120 (2013) 240–250 249\\ndepends on interest alignment. whereas pro-self representatives\\nalways act

situations partners prior information information neutral current study however appear case.even partners knowledge conveyed extreme impressions similarity dissimilarity coordination requirement supported.successful matching increased similarity ratings interpersonal liking successful mismatching regulation according cognitive model forms regulation mimicry synchrony coordination. current work looked type regulation. basic form mimicry happens largely conscious level current matching versus mismatching coordination parallels mimicry synchrony opposed different things fosters rapport liking. instance people like mimics this effect bilateral.mimicking leads greater liking rapport mimicked la furthermore facial mimicking increases people prosocial behavior mimicked engenders prosocial abele behavior moreover shown physical action synchrony fosters liking cooperation despite theme thing engenders positive interpersonal feelings number differences paradigms. mimicry synchrony action embodied action meaning body face.moreover mimicry synchrony paradigms interacting agents serve visual stimuli other.this makes mimics moves synchrony salient. tacit coordination action embodied deliberate actors explicitly interdependent.that actors aware payoff choosing particular alternative depends partly choose. open question interpersonal impressions engendered various forms regulation mediated similar psychological processes. tacit coordination involves deliberation awareness downstream effect interpersonal impressions deliberative. example people aware favorably disposed partner successful matching successful mismatching effects largely conscious.similarly increase judged intelligence successful coordination matching mismatching reasonable given simplicity coordination tasks used studies impression enhanced intelligence automatic response successful coordination.coordination teamwork coordination fundamental concern teamwork many collaborative tasks inherently mismatching tasks.loan completing mortgage applications janitors cleaning building scholars coauthoring paper need execute different actions successful efficient completion task. implication current work coordinated teamwork underscores differences members. consequence liking interpersonal members promoted.this implication contrast expected teamwork success breeds cohesion identification enhanced motivation enthusiasm.however evidence presumed effects success mixed. example concluded based meta analysis success increases task commitment interpersonal liking. possible implications mismatching coordination unfold differently teams.team tasks typically multifaceted successful performance involves matching mismatching behaviors. downstream effects successful mismatching impressions similarity liking nonexistent current studies applying results tasks involve matching mismatching coordination suggests albeit speculatively success mismatching components effect impressions success matching components tend increase cohesion.thus aggregate effect successful completion series matching mismatching coordination tasks enhance sense inclusion.additionally teamwork explicitly coordinated studies examined tacit coordination.another open question downstream effects coordination observed depend tacitness process. roles tasks explicitly assigned negotiated matching lead interpersonal attraction mismatching addressing questions current findings scale situ teamwork limited task used.even teams face situations repeat themes options constrained fluid task used.also programmed partner studies developing coordination somewhat easier faced life contexts. easier reasons.first virtue program slow instance coordination failure waiting consecutive failures
