related disciplines\\n\\nrajshree agarwal\\nglenn hoetker\\n\\nuniversity of illinois at urbana-champaign\\n\\nin an effort to respond to concerns regarding academic rigor expressed in the 1950s,\\nmanagement researchers turned to more established disciplines to help develop a\\nstronger intellectual climate. we examine the evolution of management research over\\nthe past 25 years, with a focus on its relationship with the related disciplines of\\neconomics, psychology, and sociology. using citation data for all academy of man-\\nagement journal articles published between 1980 and 2005, we document the tempo-\\nral changes in disciplinary interlinkages. we discuss the implications of these findings\\nfor the current and future state of our field.\\n\\nthe launch of the academy of management jour-\\nnal in 1958 coincided with a critical era in man-\\nagement-related research (porter & mckibbin, 1988:\\n166). important stakeholders, including university\\nleaders, faculty, and business executives, were\\ncoming to the conclusion that business schools had\\nseriously underrated the importance of research.\\ntwo influential reports, one sponsored by the ford\\nfoundation (gordon & howell, 1959) and one by\\nthe carnegie corporation (pierson, 1959), crystal-\\nlized this concern in their criticism of management\\neducation for slack standards and low-quality fac-\\nulties. the reports catalyzed two changes in busi-\\nness schools: an increased focus on intellectual\\nclimate, which included providing faculty more\\nrelease time from teaching to undertake research,\\nand the development of closer relations with rele-\\nvant underlying disciplines. these changes still re-\\nverberate through management research today.\\nhowever, just as faust failed to consider the ulti-\\nmate consequences when he advanced his quest for\\nknowledge with an infernal bargain, it may be the\\ncase that while drawing from related disciplines,\\nwe have become too bound within each individual\\ndisciplinary perspective, resulting in a multitude of\\ndivergent perspectives and a low level of paradigm\\ndevelopment (pfeffer, 1993).\\n\\nin this article, we examine the evolution of man-\\nagement research, especially its links with related\\n\\ndisciplines over time. in doing so, we use insights\\nfrom the industry evolution literature, which ad-\\ndresses the changing relevance of knowledge from\\nrelated industries as a focal industry evolves from\\ninception to maturity. for our empirical analysis,\\nwe look at all articles published in amj over the\\nlast 25 years. given amj’s status as the original\\njournal of the largest, most diverse, professional\\nassociation of management scholars, articles pub-\\nlished in amj offer an ideal empirical context in\\nwhich to examine evolutionary trends in manage-\\nment. this journal has played a critical role in\\nshaping management research over its 50 years of\\npublication, a role we believe it will continue to\\nplay in its second 50 years. thus, this 50th anni-\\nversary is an appropriate occasion to examine\\namj’s role in the intellectual discourse surround-\\ning management research.\\n\\ntheoretical framework\\n\\na brief historical backdrop\\n\\nresearch in the social sciences has a long history;\\neconomics, psychology, and sociology hail back to\\nat least the late 18th and early 19th centuries as\\ndisciplines and bodies of scholarly thought. in con-\\ntrast, management is a much younger discipline\\nand, importantly, its inception in the late 19th cen-\\ntury arose from a practical need for skilled business\\nmanagers.1 a rapid increase in the number of busi-\\n\\nboth authors contributed equally. the manuscript has\\nbenefited from comments by sara rynes,

growing concern about the academic rigor of\\ntheir programs (jeuck, 1986).\\n\\nin one of the two influential reports published in\\n1959 on the state of research in business schools,\\ngordon and howell minced no words when they\\nstated, “[the] business literature is not, in general,\\ncharacterized by challenging hypotheses, well de-\\nveloped conceptual frameworks, the use of sophis-\\nticated research techniques, penetrating analysis,\\nthe use of evidence drawn from relevant underly-\\ning disciplines—or very significant conclusions”\\n(1959: 379). according to porter and mckibbin\\n(1988) and jeuck (1986), the two reports (gordon &\\nhowell, 1959; pierson, 1959) motivated business\\nschools to give faculty more time for research and\\nto tighten relations with the scholarly disciplines\\nrelated to management. it was in this climate that\\nthe academy of management (founded in 1936)\\nlaunched the journal of the academy of manage-\\nment, later renamed the academy of management\\njournal. the first issue of this journal was pub-\\nlished in 1958, significantly after the inaugurations\\nof the american economic review (first published\\nin 1911), the american journal of sociology (1895),\\nand the american journal of psychology (1887).\\n\\nthe development of the management discipline\\nover the last 50 years is in many ways analogous to\\nthe evolution of an industry. thus, we look at the\\ngrowth of management as a discipline over the last\\n50 years through an evolutionary lens. we first\\nbriefly review the industry evolution literature and\\nthen discuss trends in management research, par-\\nticularly in the context of its connection to related\\ndisciplines and the subsequent impact this has had\\non the evolution of subfields within management.\\n\\nindustry evolution literature: a brief review\\n\\ngort and klepper (1982) discussed the diffusion\\nof innovations as a result of temporal changes in\\ntwo key types of information: information that is\\nwithin the boundaries of a focal industry, and in-\\nformation that is outside those boundaries. a nas-\\ncent industry has very little industry-specific\\nknowledge (gort & klepper, 1982) and thus has a\\nmalleable institutional environment that needs le-\\ngitimacy (aldrich & fiol, 1994; hannan & freeman,\\n1977). in such an environment, the focal industry\\nbenefits from knowledge residing in related indus-\\ntries. diversifying entrants from many related in-\\ndustries may enter a new industry (bayus & agar-\\nwal, in press; carroll, bigelow, seidel, & tsai,\\n1996). these firms differ in both capabilities (helfat\\n& lieberman, 2002; klepper & simons, 2000) and\\ncognitions (tripsas & gavetti, 2000). researchers\\n\\nhave found that the knowledge imported from re-\\nlated industries helps a new industry to leverage\\nestablished distribution networks (mitchell, 1991),\\ndevelop new knowledge (lane, 1989), and increase\\nin legitimacy (carroll et al., 1996), all of which\\nenable it to take off and grow (agarwal & bayus,\\n2002). not surprisingly, performance advantages\\naccrue to diversifying entrants—firms that have es-\\ntablished operations in related industries (bayus &\\nagarwal, in press; carroll et al., 1996; klepper &\\nsimons, 2000)—not only because these diversifiers\\nhelp shape the new industry environment, but also\\nbecause the gap between their resources and those\\nneeded for success is low (helfat & lieberman,\\n2002).\\n\\nas an industry acquires legitimacy (hannan &\\ncarroll, 1992) and undergoes a discontinuous\\ntransformation (agarwal, sarkar, & echambadi,\\n2002), the stock of industry-specific knowledge,\\nrules, and routines increases (gort & klepper,\\n1982). often a “dominant design”—an accepted\\nstandard or technology paradigm for the industry\\n(abernathy & utterback, 1978)—emerges. in the\\nmore mature phases of an industry, experience out-\\nside its established boundaries (even in related in-\\ndustries), as well as distributional infrastructure\\nand consumer ties, become less relevant as the\\nindustry develops its own knowledge base and in-\\nstitutional structure. in this latter phase, incumbent\\nfirms (gort & klepper, 1982) and firms that “spin\\nout” from the incumbents (agarwal, echambadi,\\nfranco, & sarkar, 2004; klepper, 2002) have an\\nadvantage, because their capabilities and knowl-\\nedge are better suited to the industry environment\\nthan are those of diversifying entrants.\\n\\nresearch in management:\\nan evolutionary framework\\n\\nit is not surprising, given the relative infancy of\\nmanagement as a discipline in the late 50s and\\nearly 60s, that related disciplines significantly af-\\nfected its evolutionary path. as might be expected\\nin view of the findings of research on industry\\nevolution highlighted above, the early years of the\\nfield were characterized by a small knowledge\\nstock and research judged to be intellectually sub-\\nstandard (gordon & howell, 1959; pierson, 1959).\\nlinking to the related disciplines more directly was\\nan obvious way to gain legitimacy and relevant\\nresource base, one that parallels the way early-stage\\nindustries link themselves with more mature, re-\\nlated industries: the legitimacy of management as a\\ndiscipline would be enhanced; management could\\nbenefit from the established research techniques\\nand academic rigor of the related disciplines; and\\n\\n2007 1305agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\nthe entry of researchers experienced in related dis-\\nciplines into management studies would infuse the\\nnew field with their learning by doing. in 1988,\\nporter and mckibbin documented changes in the\\nresearch climates of business schools over the 25\\nyears following the foundation reports. they re-\\nmarked that by the mid 1980s, the “research agenda\\nfor most schools looked rather different than it had\\nin the 1950s, both in amount and character” (porter\\n& mckibbin, 1988: 166). importantly, porter and\\nmckibbin highlighted the seeding of business\\nschool faculties with members from the related\\nsource disciplines, including industrial and social\\npsychologists, sociologists, economists, and even\\nhighly quantitatively oriented professors from de-\\npartments such as engineering (porter & mckibbin,\\n1988). these connections with the underlying dis-\\nciplines increased the diversity of management re-\\nsearch—which now spanned issues of economic\\nperformance, organizational behavior, managerial\\ndecision making, and more—and also enhanced the\\nacademic rigor and research climate of the field.\\n\\nfifty years have gone by since the influential\\ncarnegie and ford foundation reports. has man-\\nagement research evolved into a mature discipline?\\ntaking the volume of research articles as analogous\\nto industry output, in figure 1 we document the\\noverwhelming growth in the management disci-\\npline over the last 25 years. for journals indexed in\\nthe isi web of knowledge/social science citation\\nindex, the rate of growth in management articles\\nhas been higher than the growth in economics,\\npsychology, and sociology articles. indeed, al-\\nthough there were fewer than 200 management ar-\\nticles annually in the index during the late 80s,\\nthere were close to 1,500 management articles an-\\n\\nnually by 2005. starting at a level of output much\\nlower than the outputs of economics, psychology,\\nor sociology, management surpassed sociology in\\nthe early 90s and has come close to economics in\\nrecent years. the growth rate of management out-\\nput has slowed down during the last decade, how-\\never—as is also the case in the mature stage of an\\nevolving industry.\\n\\na more telling indicator, however, is the trend in\\nthe association of management with the academic\\ndisciplines related to it. as described above, gort\\nand klepper (1982) theorized that the relative im-\\nportance of knowledge from outside an industry’s\\nboundaries decreases as the industry matures. in its\\ninitial years, management turned to related disci-\\nplines not only for “content,” or theories, but also\\nfor “method,” or intellectual rigor (gordon & how-\\nell, 1959; pierson, 1959). as management matured,\\nboth forms of borrowing should have become ob-\\nservably less important, given the development of\\nmanagement-specific research and graduate train-\\ning, especially ph.d. programs. is this conjecture\\nsupported by empirical evidence? over time, does\\npublished management research show the maturity\\nof the field in an increased reliance on work pub-\\nlished in management journals and a decreased\\nreliance on work in nonmanagement journals, as\\nevidenced by relative proportions of citations to the\\ntwo different types of journals?\\n\\nresearch questions:\\ninterrelationships among disciplines\\n\\nwe now turn to research questions about the\\nrelative impacts of the related disciplines on man-\\nagement and how they relate to each other within\\n\\nfigure 1\\nnumber of articles per yeara\\n\\na count of articles indexed in isi web of science, smoothed via locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.\\n\\n1306 decemberacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nmanagement. each of the related disciplines—eco-\\nnomics, sociology, and psychology—studies differ-\\nent facets of societal issues and has developed dif-\\nferent stocks of both theory and methods. the core\\nresearch questions of interest, underlying assump-\\ntions, and conceptualizations of organizations and\\ntheir interactions differ dramatically in the three\\ndisciplines. thus, each management-related disci-\\npline brings with it different cognitive frameworks\\nand capabilities, much like the different cognitions\\nand capabilities of diversifying entrants from re-\\nlated industries discussed earlier (bayus & agar-\\nwal, forthcoming; klepper & simons, 2000; tripsas\\n& gavetti, 2000).\\n\\nas management has evolved, how have the dif-\\nferent related disciplines interacted with each\\nother? has there been simultaneous examination of\\ncommon issues through multiple disciplinary\\nlenses, or parallel tracks of thought that have de-\\nveloped without much interaction? simply put, is\\nmanagement research a melting pot in which in-\\nsights from many perspectives are combined, or is\\nit multidisciplinary only in the sense that it com-\\nprises work influenced by different disciplines, but\\npursued one discipline at a time?\\n\\nbefore examining these questions, we note that\\nmanagement research has bifurcated into two broad\\nsubsets, often called “micro” and “macro” to de-\\nnote the different levels of analysis on which they\\nfocus (schminke & mitchell, 2003). micro research\\nfocuses on individuals and teams, and macro re-\\nsearch focuses on organizations and extraorganiza-\\ntional issues (pearce, 2003; schminke & mitchell,\\n2003). within the academy of management (as rep-\\nresentative of management scholars), micro schol-\\nars map largely onto an organizational behavior\\ncluster and macro scholars, onto a business policy\\nand strategy cluster (pearce, 2003). further, the re-\\nlated disciplines would be expected to differen-\\ntially impact micro and macro research, given dif-\\nferences in both their primary levels of analysis and\\nthe phenomena they examine.2 thus, we treat the\\n\\nmicro and macro areas as subdisciplines within\\nmanagement and examine the evolution of each in\\nthe context of the influence of related disciplines.\\n\\nreturning to our main question of interest, there\\nis reason to expect, particularly in the early stages\\nof an academic field, that differences in the capa-\\nbilities and cognitive lenses of the different related\\ndisciplines—here, the source disciplines of eco-\\nnomics, sociology, psychology—will cause think-\\ning to follow multiple, parallel tracks. just as iner-\\ntia constrains the development of capabilities of\\ndiversifying entrants (tripsas & gavetti, 2000),\\nscholars who enter management studies from given\\nrelated disciplines may be constrained by inertia in\\nthe form of specializations and foci peculiar to\\nthose disciplines. although singularity of focus\\nmay be inevitable in the initial stages of a new\\ndiscipline, the “dominant design” that emerges\\nover time need not reflect multiple competing foci\\nor “standards.”\\n\\nindeed, one of three dominant designs for the\\nrole of related disciplines may have developed over\\ntime. one possibility is that each of the two broad\\nsubareas of management scholarship—micro and\\nmacro—has been strongly influenced by a single\\ndiscipline and, thus, the citations in work pub-\\nlished in the area would be predominantly to that\\ndiscipline alone. a second possibility is that a con-\\nfluence of multiple perspectives has influenced the\\nmicro (macro) area, as reflected in multiple disci-\\nplines being cited in work in the area and more-\\nover, in multiple disciplines being cited jointly in\\nsingle articles. a third possibility is that no single\\ndiscipline has dominated either micro or macro\\nresearch; although work in each area might cite\\nmultiple disciplines, they would exist in a state of\\ntension rather than mutuality. this tension would\\nbe reflected by citations in macro (micro) work as a\\nwhole to multiple disciplines, but citation of only\\none discipline in any given article.\\n\\naccordingly, and to summarize, three alternative\\npatterns may characterize the relationships of the\\nunderlying disciplines to micro (macro) research:\\n\\n2 psychology, for instance, focuses more on individu-\\nals and small groups. accordingly, one would expect\\npsychology to have a stronger impact on the micro rather\\nthan macro areas of management research. within man-\\nagement, issues related to individual personality and\\nsmall group dynamics lend themselves particularly well\\nto the strengths of psychology. social and organizational\\npsychologists do investigate group and team behavior,\\nyet they do not study large collectives as a rule. on the\\nother hand, sociology focuses on the institutional struc-\\ntures of society. within management, the influence of\\norganizational and interorganizational structures on\\nfirms’ and individuals’ decision making and perfor-\\n\\nmance are, for instance, ideal for examination through a\\nsociology lens. accordingly, one would expect sociolo-\\ngy’s influence to be largely in the macro areas of man-\\nagement research. finally, economics could be character-\\nized as being in the middle of the continuum. a well-\\ndeveloped literature in labor economics addresses micro\\nissues related to individuals, and other well-developed\\nliteratures, in industrial organization and international\\ntrade, deal with more macro issues related to firms, in-\\ndustries, and countries. thus, both individual and col-\\nlective concerns lend themselves to examination via\\neconomics.\\n\\n2007 1307agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\nin pattern 1, the dominant design is based on a\\nsingle related discipline, and micro (macro) man-\\nagement research predominantly contains citations\\nto that discipline; in pattern 2, the dominant design\\nis based on multiple disciplines, and individual\\nmicro (macro) management research articles con-\\ntain citations to multiple related disciplines at the\\nsame time; and in pattern 3, no dominant design is\\npresent, and micro (macro) management research\\ncontains citations to multiple related disciplines,\\nbut each individual article predominantly cites\\nonly one related discipline.\\n\\nmethods\\n\\ncontext and data\\n\\nto examine the above research questions regard-\\ning the evolution of management research and its\\nrelationship with other disciplines, we used the\\nbody of work published in the academy of man-\\nagement journal (amj) as a proxy for academic\\nscholarship in the discipline. given amj’s status as\\nthe original journal of the largest, most diverse pro-\\nfessional association in the field of management,\\narticles published in this outlet represent an ideal\\nempirical context in which to examine the evolu-\\ntionary trends in management research. indeed, the\\njournal’s current “information for contributors” ex-\\nplicitly states, “authors should make evident the\\ncontributions of specialized research to general\\nmanagement theory and practice.” additionally,\\narticles published in amj need to have both theo-\\nretical and empirical components (colquitt &\\nzapata-phelan, 2007), and a recent study by\\nschminke and mitchell (2003) found micro and\\nmacro areas of management research to be equally\\nwell represented in amj.\\n\\nfor our empirical analysis, we obtained citation\\ndata for all amj articles published in the period\\n1980–2005 from the isi web of knowledge/social\\nscience citation index produced by thomson sci-\\nentific.3 the three linked data sets used for the\\ncitation analysis included: (1) all articles published\\nin amj from 1980 to 2005 (source articles), (2) all\\narticles cited by these amj articles (cited articles),\\nand (3) all articles that subsequently cited these\\namj articles (citing articles).\\n\\nthe citation analysis indicated that the 1,530\\namj source articles were associated with 2,080\\nunique authors at 488 institutions in 31 countries.\\nthese articles included 36,441 citations to 15,173\\n\\nunique articles in 848 distinct journals. the 14,065\\nauthors of the cited articles were associated with\\n2,178 institutions in 72 countries. the amj source\\narticles were subsequently cited 54,417 times in\\n22,234 unique articles that appeared in 1,293 dis-\\ntinct journals. the 21,866 authors of these articles\\nare associated with 3,804 institutions in 92\\ncountries.\\n\\nto supplement the citation analysis with some\\nqualitative assessments, we also conducted a sur-\\nvey of the 2005–06 amj editorial board. the survey\\ninstrument consisted of 23 questions, both norma-\\ntive and positive in nature.4 the survey questions\\nwere designed to elicit board members’ judgments\\non a series of issues related to the academic dis-\\ncourse surrounding management research. we re-\\nceived 91 responses, which represented a 76 per-\\ncent response rate. respondents were broadly\\nrepresentative of the editorial board. the average\\ntenure on the board was 4.2 years, with a range of\\nfrom one month to 12 years. the most frequent\\ndepartmental affiliation was management (59%),\\nfollowed by strategy (17%) and organizational be-\\nhavior (14%). the most frequent fields of doctoral\\nstudy of the respondents were organizational be-\\nhavior (30%), strategy (26%), psychology (18%),\\nand industrial relations (8.5%).\\n\\njournal categorization\\n\\ntemporal changes in links to related disciplines\\nshould be reflected in the citation patterns of amj\\narticles. thus, we treat citations to work from jour-\\nnals in management (as distinct from journals in\\nrelated disciplines) as reflecting the extent to\\nwhich amj authors have drawn from internal ver-\\nsus external stocks of knowledge. to meaningfully\\nlink the citation data to disciplines related to man-\\nagement and to identify an amj article as either\\nmicro or macro in content, it was necessary to\\nappropriately categorize the citing/cited journals.\\ncategorization at the discipline level was based on\\nthe isi’s 56-category system. most journals belong\\nto a single category, but some were in 2 or 3. two\\nadjustments to isi’s categorization scheme were\\nnecessary. first, we collapsed its 10 psychology\\ncategories into a single one. second, we modified\\nisi’s scheme for journals related to business and/or\\nmanagement into three partially overlapping cate-\\n\\n3 although data for articles published from 1958\\nthrough 1979 would have enhanced our study, these are\\nunavailable in electronic form.\\n\\n4 we pretested the survey and then administered it to\\nboard members through the surveymonkey web site to\\nensure control over the order in which the survey items\\nwere completed and accurate, automatic compilation of\\nresponses.\\n\\n1308 decemberacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\ngories: “business,” “management,” and “business,\\nfinance.” this typology did not allow us to distin-\\nguish between “management,” as commonly un-\\nderstood to include strategy, organization theory,\\norganization behavior/human resource manage-\\nment, and international business, and other fields\\nof business (e.g., finance.). therefore, we created\\ntwo exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories,\\n“management” and “business, not management.”\\nany journal categorized by isi as “management”\\nwas placed in “management.” journals categorized\\nas “business” or “business, finance” that were not\\nalso categorized as “management” were placed in\\n“business, not management.”\\n\\nwe further categorized the management journals\\nas having either a general, a micro, or a macro\\nfocus, and each of us independently coded this\\ngroup of 60 journals into these three areas.5 in 88\\npercent of the cases, we agreed on coding. in the\\nseven cases of disagreement, categorization was re-\\nsolved via discussion. the appendix presents our\\ncategorization of the journals. we then used the\\nmicro/macro journal classifications to categorize\\nthe amj articles. if an article cited more work from\\nmacro journals than from micro ones, we classified\\nit as a macro article. similarly, if an article cited\\nmore work from micro journals than macro, it was\\nclassified as a micro article.\\n\\nanalyses\\n\\nto examine the evolution and interdisciplinary\\nlinks of management research (as manifested in\\namj), we examined the cited and citing articles of\\nindividual articles. for ease of interpretation of the\\nanalysis, we represent these patterns in figure 2. in\\n\\neach panel, squares represent amj articles, whereas\\nthe other shapes represent the disciplines of citing\\nor cited articles for a focal amj article. arrows\\nrepresent knowledge flow, where a 3 b indicates\\nthat knowledge has flowed from a to b—that is, b\\ncites a. panels 2a and 2b depict disciplinary group-\\nings of articles respectively cited by and citing a\\nfocal amj article. panel 2a shows the case in which\\narticles cited by amj are grouped by disciplines,\\nwhich appear as dark shapes. this depiction illus-\\ntrates our examination of the evolutionary trends in\\ndisciplinary relationships through the modeling of\\ndisciplinary citations in amj articles as a function\\nof chronological time. similarly, in panel 2b, we\\ndepict the disciplines that cite a focal amj article as\\nlight shapes. in panel 2c, we depict the combined\\ncase; the dark shapes continue to depict the disci-\\nplinary affiliation of articles cited by amj, and the\\nlight shapes depict the disciplinary affiliation of\\narticles citing amj. panel 2d depicts the relation-\\nship between the disciplinary basis of citations in a\\nfocal amj article and the disciplinary basis of an\\namj article that subsequently cites it. panels 2c and\\n2d allow us, in the supplementary analysis section,\\nto examine further the dissemination of knowledge\\nwithin management and across disciplines via the\\nmanagement literature.\\n\\nresults\\n\\ndescriptive statistics\\n\\nbefore turning to a formal analysis of our ques-\\ntions of interest, we provide some descriptive sta-\\ntistics based on our data. as noted above, manage-\\nment research is inherently interdisciplinary and\\nhas traditionally drawn insights from related disci-\\nplines such as psychology, sociology, and econom-\\nics. indeed, results from the editorial board survey\\nindicated that 62 percent of the board members\\nthought it was critical or very important that amj\\ndraw on related disciplines. further, 59 percent of\\nthe members surveyed thought that amj accom-\\nplished this goal to a moderate degree, and 29 per-\\ncent thought it did so to a high or very high degree.\\nwhen asked about how important it was for amj to\\ninfluence other disciplines in turn, a smaller per-\\ncentage (41%) thought it was very important or\\ncritical, but fewer still (only 13%) believed that\\namj accomplished this goal to a high or very high\\ndegree.\\n\\nthe citations data seem to be consistent with the\\neditorial board expectations and perceptions. in\\ntable 1, we provide citation statistics for the disci-\\nplines that show links with amj, both aggregated\\nover the 1980–2005 period and broken down into\\n\\n5 we conducted robustness checks of our categoriza-\\ntion using the following procedure: rather than classify-\\ning the journals into micro or macro directly, we classi-\\nfied them on the basis of their fields of study (i.e.,\\nentrepreneurship, human relations, organization behav-\\nior, strategy, etc.). we then computed correlations of the\\ncitations of these field-based journals in the amj articles.\\nentrepreneurship, international business, strategy, and\\ntechnology had significant, positive, pairwise correlation\\ncoefficients and thus formed the macro cluster. simi-\\nlarly, human resources and organization behavior had\\nsignificant, positive correlations with each other and\\nformed the micro cluster. these clusters were found to be\\nvery similar to the clusters of aom divisions reported in\\npearce (2003). further, each of the fields in the macro\\ncluster was negatively correlated with the fields in the\\nmicro cluster. the clusters obtained via this alternative\\nprocedure were consistent with the micro/macro catego-\\nrization based on a direct inspection of the journals.\\n\\n2007 1309agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\nthree equal periods. table 1a rank-orders the disci-\\nplines on the basis of aggregate citations by amj\\narticles (panel 2a of figure 2), and table 1b rank-\\norders the disciplines on the basis of aggregate ci-\\ntations to amj articles (panel 2b of figure 2).\\n\\nprimary analyses\\n\\nfigure 3 tracks the proportion of citations in amj\\narticles that were to the management literature,\\nyear by year. there has been a fairly steady increase\\nover time, from around 40 percent in the early\\n\\n1980s to just under 60 percent in recent years.\\nregressing the proportion of citations to the man-\\nagement literature against years confirms the visual\\nimpression of an annual increase of .8 percentage\\npoints per year (p ! .01). we also examined cita-\\ntions of amj articles in management and nonman-\\nagement articles. citations of amj articles in both\\nmanagement and nonmanagement journals have\\nincreased over time, growing annually by an aver-\\nage of 27.53 and 23.34 respectively (p ! .01 for\\nboth). interestingly, the rate of increase does not\\nsignificantly differ over these two categories (p \"\\n\\ntable 1\\ncitations by and to amj articlesa\\n\\ndiscipline 1980 to 1987 1988 to 1996 1997 to

of management re-\\nsearch published in amj on both management and\\nnonmanagement research has increased signifi-\\ncantly over time.\\n\\nwe next turn to whether each of two broad areas\\nof management research, micro and macro, (1) is\\nstrongly influenced by a single discipline, (2) is\\nstrongly influenced by a confluence of disciplines,\\nor (3) exhibits tension among disciplines. to inves-\\n\\ntigate this issue, we examined (1) the proportion of\\ncitations in amj articles to economics, sociology,\\nand psychology, respectively, and (2) the average\\ncorrelation between the count of citations to each\\ndiscipline within articles.\\n\\nwe begin with the outcomes of our analysis of\\nthe micro segment of the management literature. as\\nfigure 4 shows, micro amj articles have been dom-\\ninated by psychology since 1985, a dominance that\\n\\nfigure 2\\nsample citation analyses\\n\\nfigure 3\\ntrends in the proportion of amj citations to the management literature\\n\\n2007 1311agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\nhas been increasing over time (pattern 1 above).\\nsociology and economics have consistently played\\nsmaller roles. this finding is consistent with a\\ndominance of a single discipline. examining the\\ncovariance of the number of citations to disciplines\\nin amj articles also supports this finding, as dem-\\nonstrated in figure 5. psychology’s correlation with\\nsociology is near zero, indicating no co-occurrence\\nbetween the two disciplines, and both psychology\\nand sociology have increasingly negative correla-\\ntions with economics. in summary, the evidence\\n\\nstrongly supports pattern 1, the dominance of a\\nsingle discipline (psychology) for micro-oriented\\namj articles.\\n\\nturning to the macro literature, we find a very\\ndifferent result. as figure 6 shows, citations to\\npsychology, economics, and sociology have been\\nroughly equal in macro amj articles, indicating the\\nlack of a singular dominant discipline (pattern 1).\\nto distinguish between simultaneous citation of\\nmultiple disciplines in individual articles (pattern\\n2) and use of different disciplinary lenses by differ-\\n\\nfigure

a discipline may be dominant\\n\\nin an article, but it will not cite all the disciplines\\ntogether. the correlations are generally negative,\\nwith economics and psychology having an increas-\\ningly negative correlation over time. sociology’s\\n\\nfigure 6\\nproportion of disciplinary citations in amj macro articles\\n\\nfigure 7\\ncorrelation of disciplinary citations in amj macro articles\\n\\n2007 1313agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\ncorrelation with economics and psychology has\\nsteadily moved from a negative value in the early\\n1990s to approximately zero in recent years. thus,\\nwe find that the macro-oriented research in man-\\nagement is multidisciplinary, but only draws on\\none discipline at a time.\\n\\nsupplemental analyses\\n\\nour primary analysis suggested two topics mer-\\niting supplemental analysis. first, the maturation\\nof management as an independent discipline sug-\\ngested that it would be appropriate to examine its\\nrelationship with the source disciplines. second,\\nhaving examined the relationships of citations to\\nthe three focal related disciplines (psychology, so-\\nciology, and economics) within articles, we turned\\nto the diffusion of knowledge from these fields\\nacross articles over time.\\n\\nwe first examined the role of the management\\nliterature and its relationship to the source disci-\\nplines in management research. figure 8 shows a\\nsteep increase in the proportion of citations to man-\\nagement research in micro amj articles, with man-\\nagement nearly matching the citation level of psy-\\nchology in recent years. however, the correlation\\nbetween citations to psychology and management\\nindicates that these two literatures appear indepen-\\ndently, suggesting two paradigms for micro re-\\n\\nsearch, one based on psychology and the other\\nbased on management. this trend has actually\\nstrengthened over the last 15 years.\\n\\nfigure 9 provides the relevant information for\\nmacro articles. here, management is by far the\\ndominant disciplinary source, showing steady\\ngrowth in prevalence over the last 25 years, at least\\npartially at the expense of psychology. the corre-\\nlations among citation counts suggest that distinct\\nparadigms prevail, albeit to a lesser degree than\\nthey do in micro research. thus, we again see mul-\\ntidisciplinarity, one discipline at a time. psychol-\\nogy has a negative correlation with management,\\nand both sociology and economics have correla-\\ntions under .25. despite recent increases, the cor-\\nrelation between management citations and sociol-\\nogy citations has declined over the last 25 years,\\nand the management correlation with economics\\nhas increased only modestly.\\n\\nwe now turn to examining the diffusion of dis-\\nciplinary knowledge across articles over time. a\\ndiffusion of knowledge implies that the influence\\nof a particular research article extends beyond its\\nroots. thus, an examination of the relationship be-\\ntween the citations made by an article and the\\nsubsequent citations of that article is particularly\\ngermane to the question of whether knowledge cre-\\nated within management enters conversations car-\\nried on outside of management.\\n\\nfigure 8\\nsupplemental analysis: disciplinary citations and correlations in amj micro articles\\n\\n1314 decemberacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nwe examined two aspects of this question, which\\nare represented in panels 2c and 2d of figure 2,\\nrespectively. first, what is the relationship be-\\ntween the disciplines that an amj article cites and\\nthe disciplines of the (amj and non-amj) articles\\nthat subsequently cite it? (see panel 2c.) tracking\\nthese patterns would address the management lit-\\nerature’s role as a potential disseminator of knowl-\\nedge across disciplines. if an amj article that cites\\na given discipline heavily is subsequently cited by\\narticles from a range of disciplines, the manage-\\nment literature would appear to have disseminated\\nknowledge among the related disciplines.\\n\\ntable 2 addresses the first dimension, knowledge\\ndiffusion over disciplines. it shows the correlation\\n\\nof disciplinary citations by and to a focal article\\n(the dark xi and light shaded xj in panel 2c of\\nfigure 2). the table is not, we note, a typical cor-\\nrelation matrix, since the xi and xj represent cita-\\ntions to and by disciplinary journals. a positive\\ncorrelation for a diagonal element indicates that\\narticles based largely on discipline xi are subse-\\nquently cited by articles categorized into discipline\\nxi. thus, it indicates discussions occurring within\\ndisciplinary perspectives.\\n\\na positive correlation for an off-diagonal element\\nindicates that articles based on xi are subsequently\\ncited by articles in discipline xj. thus, the manage-\\nment research is disseminating knowledge among\\nthe source disciplines, supporting interdisciplinary\\ndiscussion. a negative correlation in an off-diago-\\nnal indicates no such flow of knowledge via the\\nmanagement literature.\\n\\npositive correlations in diagonal and off-diagonal\\nelements are not mutually exclusive. that is, the\\nmanagement research could support both intra-\\nand interdisciplinary discussion. in fact, we find\\nthat this is not the case. in general, management\\nresearch—as exemplified by amj—supports intra-\\ndisciplinary, but not interdisciplinary, discussion.\\n\\nturning first to economics, we find a strong pos-\\nitive correlation (r ! .48) between citations to work\\nin economics by an amj article and subsequent\\ncitations by economics-based articles. there is a\\n\\nfigure 9\\nsupplemental analysis: disciplinary citations and correlations in macro articles\\n\\ntable 2\\ncorrelations of

subsequent\\ncites by psychology-based articles (r ! –.13) and a\\nsmall but positive correlation with subsequent cites\\nby sociology-based work (r ! .10). thus, as eco-\\nnomics knowledge enters management research, it\\nsubsequently informs economics itself and, to a\\nmuch smaller degree, sociology.\\n\\ncitations to psychology-based articles are\\nstrongly correlated with subsequent citations by\\npsychology-based articles (r ! .45). they are nega-\\ntively correlated with subsequent cites by work in\\neconomics (r ! –.13) and management (–.22) and\\nuncorrelated with subsequent cites in sociology ar-\\nticles. thus, the discussion of psychological con-\\nstructs in the management literature serves to in-\\nform psychology, but not other disciplines.\\n\\nas for the other source disciplines, citations in\\namj articles to work in sociology are strongly cor-\\nrelated with later citations of the amj articles by\\nwork in sociology (r ! .49, p \" .01). however, in\\ncontrast to the other source disciplines, the corre-\\nlations between sociology citations in amj articles\\nand later citations of the amj work in the other two\\ndisciplines are not negative.\\n\\namj articles that heavily cite work in manage-\\nment are relatively frequently cited by subsequent\\nmanagement articles (r ! .22). in addition, articles\\nthat draw relatively more heavily on the management\\ndiscipline are also more likely to be subsequently\\ncited in both economics (r ! .16) and sociology arti-\\ncles (r ! .18). although these correlations are low,\\nthey show that to some extent, the management dis-\\ncipline is now influencing certain disciplines previ-\\nously considered only sources. work in psychology,\\nin contrast, is less likely to cite an article that cites\\nmanagement heavily.\\n\\nthe second aspect we examined was the relation-\\nship between the disciplinary basis of a focal amj\\narticle and the disciplinary bases of amj articles\\nthat subsequently cite it (panel 2d in figure 2). that\\nis, what types of amj articles build upon, say,\\nheavily economics-based work—other economics-\\nbased articles, or those drawing from a broader\\nrange of disciplines? a heavily discipline-based\\namj article being cited more often by articles that\\ndraw from the same base suggests niche conversa-\\ntions without much cross-fertilization to and from\\nother disciplines. in contrast, a heavily discipline-\\nbased amj article being subsequently cited by more\\nbroadly based articles suggests interaction among\\nscholars with different disciplinary lineages and\\ndiffusion of knowledge beyond a single discipline.\\n\\ntable 3 examines the second dimension of\\nknowledge diffusion, the dissemination of disci-\\npline-based knowledge within management. this\\ntable is similar in structure to table 2, except that\\n\\ntable 3 reports the correlations between the disci-\\nplines cited by a focal amj article and by subse-\\nquent amj articles that cite it (panel 2d in figure 2).\\nthus, positive values on the diagonal would show\\nthat, for example, amj articles based primarily on\\neconomics are picked up by other amj articles\\nbased primarily on economics. positive values on\\nthe off-diagonal would show that management re-\\nsearch is bringing two disciplines together, sup-\\nporting interdisciplinary discussion, and a negative\\ncorrelation would indicate that the two disciplines\\nremain aloof from each other in the management\\nliterature.\\n\\nlooking first at economics, we find a significant,\\npositive correlation (.27) between economics cita-\\ntions in a focal article and those in amj articles that\\nsubsequently cite it. in contrast, there is a negative\\ncorrelation between economics and psychology\\n(r ! –.15) and a nonsignificant correlation (r ! .01)\\nwith sociology. the pattern for psychology is some-\\nwhat similar. we find a significant, positive corre-\\nlation (r ! .19) between psychology citations in a\\nfocal amj article and in amj articles that subse-\\nquently cite it. again, in contrast, there is a nega-\\ntive correlation with economics (–.21) and a\\nsmaller negative correlation with sociology (–.07).\\nsociology shows a somewhat different pattern. like\\neconomics and psychology, it has a positive corre-\\nlation with itself (r ! .21). however, it also has a\\npositive correlation with economics (r ! .15) and a\\nnonsignificant correlation with psychology (r !\\n–.02). this pattern suggests that amj articles that\\ndraw heavily on sociology are subsequently cited\\nby amj articles that draw upon sociology and/or\\neconomics. this pattern is consistent with the\\ngrowth of economic sociology and organizational\\neconomics as perspectives for examining business\\nphenomena. further, focal articles drawing on so-\\nciology are not unduly neglected by subsequent\\narticles in psychology.\\n\\nthere is evidence of a positive, but slight, inter-\\n\\ntable 3\\ncorrelations of disciplines in a focal amj\\n\\narticle and in amj articles that cite it\\n\\ncited by

indicating that the\\ndisciplines of management and psychology remain\\ndiscrete in the context of management research.\\n\\nin summary, we find little evidence that the man-\\nagement literature (as represented by amj) engages\\nin interdisciplinary discussion as it moves forward.\\nthe partial exception is sociology, which appears\\nto have disseminated more broadly within the man-\\nagement literature.\\n\\ndiscussion and conclusion\\n\\nalmost 50 years after two influential reports rec-\\nommended that business schools improve their in-\\ntellectual climates and develop closer relations\\nwith “relevant underlying disciplines” (gordon &\\nhowell, 1959; pierson, 1959; porter & mckibbin,\\n1988), we undertook this study to examine the evo-\\nlution of research in management. drawing on in-\\nsights from the industry evolution literature, we\\ntheorized about trends in the citation patterns of\\nrelated disciplines in management and about the\\nrelative impacts of the related disciplines on any\\ndominant design that may have emerged in\\nmanagement.\\n\\nusing citation analysis data from 1980–2005 for\\nthe academy of management journal, we found\\nsignificant support for the maturing of management\\nas a discipline. the internal stock of knowledge of\\nthe discipline has grown substantially and, consis-\\ntently with this growth, amj articles increasingly\\ncite management research.\\n\\ninterestingly, the impact of related disciplines on\\nmanagement research and the dominant design for\\napplying those disciplines differs between the mi-\\ncro and macro areas of management research. in the\\nmicro area, psychology is clearly the dominant dis-\\ncipline—citations to psychology journals exceed\\ncitations to management journals, and citations to\\neconomics and sociology journals account for less\\nthan 5 percent of the total. in contrast, disciplinary\\nimpact in the macro area is much more diverse,\\nwith none of the related disciplines predominating.\\ncitations to management journals in the macro area\\nhave been steadily increasing and now represent a\\nmajority, while citations to economics, psychology,\\nand sociology journals have converged to approxi-\\nmately 10 percent each. perhaps even more striking\\nare the results regarding the correlations among dis-\\nciplinary citation counts. the trends indicate a de-\\ncline, and in most cases, an increasingly negative\\n\\nlikelihood of multiple disciplines being represented\\nin the same research article. thus, when management\\nresearchers do draw on the related disciplines, we\\nseem to do so one discipline at a time.\\n\\nbefore moving to the implications of our findings,\\nit is important that we acknowledge some limitations\\nof our research. first, our analysis rests on the as-\\nsumption that amj articles are a representative sam-\\nple of research in management. to the extent that this\\nassumption is violated, our results may differ from\\nthose of a more comprehensive analysis that includes\\nall articles published in the management discipline.\\nsecond, our focus on citations by and to amj implied\\nthat we could not undertake a “network” analysis of\\nthe disciplinary linkages of the type that biehl, kim,\\nand wade conducted (2006) for links among journals\\nincluded in the financial times ranking of business\\nschools. our results on interdisciplinary links would\\nhave been strengthened by an analysis of all inflows\\nand outflows of knowledge, as represented by the\\npairwise links among the related disciplines rather\\nthan as represented by links to a single management\\njournal. another important limitation of our study is\\nthat our reliance on citations and quantitative analy-\\nsis do not permit a qualitative assessment of the im-\\npact that ideas within management and from related\\ndisciplines have had on management research. al-\\nthough citations in general correlate with the impact\\nof ideas within a discipline, differences in norms for\\ncitations may affect cross-disciplinary comparisons.\\n\\nthe above limitations notwithstanding, what do\\nthese results indicate about the state of the disci-\\npline of management? we offer some speculations.\\nalthough the signs of maturity and the evidence\\nthat a strong body of management-related knowl-\\nedge has developed are encouraging, the results\\nregarding cross-disciplinary links are of some con-\\ncern. the applied discipline of management does\\ndraw on psychological, economic, and sociological\\nperspectives, yet these perspectives are used as sin-\\ngle, specialized lenses.\\n\\nin the micro area, economics and sociology are\\nall but ignored. although a case can be made that\\nsociology has relatively little to offer at the individ-\\nual or small-group level, the same cannot be said\\nfor economics, which has a rich tradition of exam-\\nining issues related to individuals within labor eco-\\nnomics. the primary focus in micro research on\\npsychology alone may be related to a reduction in\\nindustrial relations programs,6 which are tradition-\\nally interdisciplinary. absent integrated multidis-\\n\\n6 the university of wisconsin and the university of\\niowa, for example, no longer have industrial relations\\nprograms.\\n\\n2007 1317agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\nciplinary ph.d. programs, the costs of boundary\\nspanning become inordinately high, since manage-\\nment students attempting to span boundaries have\\nto master disciplinary courses in more than one\\ndepartment and integrate multiple perspectives on\\ntheir own. this state of affairs may result in a\\nself-reinforcing trend toward single-discipline\\ndominance. absent exposure to economics through\\na multidisciplinary program, doctoral students\\nwho later become management scholars in the mi-\\ncro area may focus primarily on psychology. this\\nlimitation also has implications for schools of man-\\nagement recruiting micro researchers who are\\ntrained within economics—it is less likely that a\\nsearch committee comprised primarily of psychol-\\nogists will hire micro researchers from a relatively\\nalien discipline.\\n\\nin the macro area, although all three source dis-\\nciplines seem to be equally represented, the nega-\\ntive or near-zero correlations among them indicate\\nonce again that when one perspective is utilized,\\nthe others are ignored. further, the lack of subse-\\nquent citations of the research based on one disci-\\npline in research based on another seems to suggest\\nthe existence of discipline-based subgroups or\\ncliques of scholars. as a result, the situation may be\\nno less troubling than what exists in micro man-\\nagement research. indeed, the “babelization” of\\nmacro management research may be mirrored in\\ntrends whereby management departments “special-\\nize” in disciplinary foci. mcgrath (2007) discusses\\nthe disturbing fact that management departments at\\nhighly ranked universities prefer recruiting directly\\nfrom disciplinary departments rather than from\\nmanagement and give more weight to publications\\nin disciplinary journals than to those in manage-\\nment journals in their tenure deliberations. the\\nincreased singularity in disciplinary focus can\\nagain be self-reinforcing: recruiting and tenure\\ncommittees may prefer to hire faculty who are sim-\\nilar to themselves, thus causing parallel schools of\\nthought to develop without the benefit of integra-\\ntion of insights from one another.\\n\\nin part, our results mirror the unease among re-\\nsearchers in the related disciplines themselves.\\nmuch has been written in the disciplinary journals\\nregarding the strained relationships between, say,\\neconomics and sociology (baron & hannan, 1994;\\ngimeno & woo, 1996; swedberg, 1987) and eco-\\nnomics and psychology (lewin, 1996; lichtenstein\\n& slovic, 1971; smith, 1991).7 these articles high-\\n\\nlight the need to examine the underlying assump-\\ntions of mainstream thought, integrate different\\nperspectives, and build theory on alternative be-\\nhavioral assumptions. such voicing of dissonance\\nmay have helped the growth and complexity of\\nissues examined within disciplines, if not necessar-\\nily between them. for example, in economics, “ra-\\ntional” theories have had to make room for “behav-\\nioral” ones, with a concurrent acknowledgement of\\nthe value offered by sociology and psychology\\n(lewin, 1996).\\n\\ncole (1983) and pfeffer (1993) highlighted the\\nimportance of a high level of paradigm develop-\\nment within a discipline, since strong consensus\\non theoretical and methodological approaches en-\\nables more efficient communication and permits\\ninterdependent activity and continued growth by\\ncreating a positive feedback loop between para-\\ndigm development and advancement of knowl-\\nedge. thus, in the above example of mainstream\\neconomics’ adaptation to behavioral critiques from\\nsociologists and psychologists, the high level of\\nparadigm development may have proved fruitful,\\nsince a disagreement can be resolved on the basis of\\nagreed-upon ways of resolving theoretical and\\nmethodological disputes.\\n\\nthe mirroring of such disciplinary conflicts in\\nmanagement, however, may have a negative conse-\\nquence for its continued evolution, given a low\\nlevel of paradigm development (pfeffer, 1993). in\\nadopting the foundation reports’ recommendation\\nthat management look to the related disciplines to\\nimprove intellectual climate and research rigor, we\\nmanagement scholars may have inadvertently done\\nourselves a disservice. since multiple disciplines\\nhave relevance to management, we may have di-\\nluted our paradigm development by viewing our\\nfield as a multidisciplinary “[large] tent in which\\nfundamentally any theoretical perspective or meth-\\nodological approach is as valid as any other” (pfef-\\nfer, 1993).\\n\\nto be sure, diversity of thought, just like diver-\\nsity of design, is valuable at all stages of the evolu-\\ntion of an industry or a discipline, and theories and\\nmethodologies introduced by scholars from related\\ndisciplines certainly provide value to management\\nas it continues to evolve. however, the extent to\\nwhich the value is captured depends on the ability\\nof our discipline to assimilate relevant perspec-\\ntives, which itself relates to whether consensus ex-\\nists on the value of a disciplined integration of\\nmultiple perspectives. it is important to note that\\nby disciplined integration, we do not mean mixing\\na potpourri of ideas, but an integration based on a\\nsystematic examination of the underlying differ-\\nences in assumptions, central research questions,\\n\\n7 the relative lack of attention or tension between\\npsychology and sociology may be a result of little overlap\\nin their focal levels of analysis.\\n\\n1318 decemberacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nand orientations of relevant ideas. if, on the other\\nhand, the related source disciplines exist in some\\ndisharmony with each other, management is more\\nlikely to be fragmented and dissonant, a cause for\\nconcern as articulated by pfeffer (1993).\\n\\nwhen interpreted in this light, our results sug-\\ngesting that the micro area of research has a single\\ndisciplinary influence may indicate that it has\\nstronger paradigm development than the macro\\narea. this does not, however, mean that micro re-\\nsearchers face less of a challenge than macro man-\\nagement researchers. within micro management re-\\nsearch, the stronger core presence of psychology\\nmay enable assimilation of insights from econom-\\nics, and a continued evolution in the micro area\\nmay benefit from an examination of what econom-\\nics has to offer. to the extent, though, that the two\\ndisciplinary perspectives represent fundamental\\ndifferences in values, assumptions, and orienta-\\ntion, these latter effects may dominate paradig-\\nmatic consensus in terms of receptivity to “integrat-\\ning” economics into its fold.\\n\\nin contrast, the macro area of research may face a\\ndifferent set of issues. this area needs a better\\nintegration of the disciplinary perspectives, rather\\nthan the current multidisciplinary approach of\\ndrawing on only one discipline at a time. the lack\\nof strong paradigm development is of concern, for\\nthe reasons explicated by pfeffer (1993). at the\\nsame time, there may be a better chance for a dis-\\nciplined integration of the related disciplinary per-\\nspectives, given that the correlations among disci-\\nplines are less negative, or even slightly positive.\\n\\nperhaps one important way to resolve these prob-\\nlems would be to recall the early motives for the\\nfounding of business schools: a perceived need for\\nscholarship with practical relevance and for man-\\nagers equipped to deal with real-world problems.\\nmanagement research can create value when theory\\ndevelopment has been uniquely motivated by the\\nchallenges faced by firms and managers (helfat,\\n2007; mcgrath, 2007). so motivated, management\\nresearch can provide theoretical insights not avail-\\nable from the related disciplines alone. we argue\\nthat, to advance management research, it is not\\nmerely enough to conduct psychology-, sociology-,\\nor economics-based research in a business setting.\\ndoing so creates little value beyond that available\\nin the particular related discipline. rather, it is\\nnecessary to connect disciplinary insights with\\nthose generated by the increasingly rich manage-\\nment discipline. beyond generating unique theoret-\\nical advances, such combinations would help ad-\\ndress a major critique of management research and\\neducation: that it no longer relates to real business\\nproblems. unlike most other areas of academic en-\\n\\ndeavor, management research ultimately must pro-\\nvide the requisite theory and conceptual frame-\\nworks that help in managing and leading people in\\nbusiness organizations (alsop, 2007).\\n\\nthe atheoretical approach of the 1940s and 50s\\nfailed to provide those frameworks, partially trig-\\ngering the subsequent disciplinary focus. however,\\nif that focus leads to theoretical and conceptual\\nframeworks that do not inform those who manage\\nfirms and lead people, management research will\\nhave failed to an equal degree. a parallel can be\\nfound in the challenge of teaching management.\\nrichard schmalensee, dean of the mit sloan\\nschool of management, relates having former ge\\nchairman jack welch teach a class: “a lot of what\\nhe talked about related to theory taught in other\\nclasses, but jack doesn’t make the connection and\\nwe’re not sure students do either” (alsop, 2007;\\nemphasis added). mit paired welch with a profes-\\nsor to ensure that students made those connections;\\nsimilarly, theoretically rigorous work from the\\nmanagement discipline can and should be com-\\nbined with insights from other disciplines to ad-\\nvance theory and frameworks that advance the\\npractice of management. (for an elaboration of this\\nview and descriptions of other possible actions that\\ncan bridge theory and practice, see shapiro, kirk-\\nman, and courtney [2006]).\\n\\nour results suggest that it is early days in the\\nprocess of creating that integration. in both the\\nmicro and macro realms, the management literature\\nplays a substantial role, but it is not significantly\\npaired with the related disciplines. the consis-\\ntently weak correlation between psychology and\\nmanagement in the micro realm suggests not a pair-\\ning, but rather two distinct approaches—one based\\non the management literature, the other on psy-\\nchology. the same situation exists, although per-\\nhaps less extremely, in the macro realm, with nei-\\nther economics nor sociology being highly\\nintegrated with management. with the maturation\\nof management as a discipline, the field is poised to\\nadvance this integration.\\n\\nunfortunately, although the field would benefit\\ncollectively from this integration, it is far from clear\\nthat individuals would benefit from attempting it.\\nseveral challenges loom. first, it is becoming in-\\ncreasingly difficult to remain current in one disci-\\npline, let alone master multiple disciplines. junior\\nfaculty are in many ways best positioned to do so,\\nas they have often recently taken a broad range of\\ncourses. however, the demands of the promotion\\nand tenure process strongly discourage such an\\ninvestment on their part. the resulting inertia often\\npersists even once tenure is earned. secondly, the\\nreview process may discourage this type of integra-\\n\\n2007 1319agarwal and hoetker\\n\\n\\n\\ntion. papers that utilize more than one discipline\\nneed to get “buy in” from multiple reviewers who\\nappreciate multiple perspectives. the reward/cost\\nratio for an individual scholar seems low here be-\\ncause the chances of getting such buy-in may be\\nlow, and it is unclear that there is any greater pres-\\ntige for such a paper if it does successfully navigate\\nthe review process.8\\n\\nas we look forward to the next 50 years of re-\\nsearch in our discipline, then, there is much reason\\nto celebrate, and also more reason to embrace the\\nchallenges that face us. management has clearly\\nevolved into a distinct discipline, and it has greatly\\nbenefited from its bonds with related disciplines.\\nat this juncture, though, it also behooves us as\\nmanagement researchers to examine these connec-\\ntions more closely to ensure that they do not bind\\nus, but rather enable us to provide valuable insights\\nregarding management practice. an integrated, dis-\\nciplined approach toward our disciplinary bonds\\nwill go a long way in achieving this objective. we\\nneed to be cautious in how we interact with the\\nrelated disciplines. certainly we need to welcome\\ndiscipline-based scholars with theoretical and\\nmethodological insights that will strengthen our\\nresearch. however, we also need to be wary of\\nbondage to a singularity of disciplinary focus that\\ncan blind one to other useful perspectives. produc-\\ntive yet cautious interaction may require manage-\\nment researchers (whether they are diversifying en-\\ntrants from related disciplines, or de novo entrants\\ntrained within) to move outside our comfort zones\\nand grow through a disciplined integration of rele-\\nvant perspectives. it may also require a change in\\nhow journals conduct reviews, so that authors who\\nengage in such boundary spanning do not meet\\nwith resistance from reviewers bound by singular\\ndisciplinary foci.\\n'"

third possibility that single discipline dominated either micro macro research although work each area might cite multiple disciplines they would exist state tension rather than mutuality.this tension would reflected citations macro micro work whole multiple disciplines citation only discipline given article.accordingly summarize three alternative patterns characterize relationships underlying disciplines micro macro research psychology instance focuses more individuals small groups.accordingly would expect psychology have stronger impact micro rather than macro areas management research.within management issues related individual personality small group dynamics lend themselves particularly well strengths psychology.social organizational psychologists investigate group team behavior they study large collectives rule. other hand sociology focuses institutional structures society.within management influence organizational interorganizational structures firms individuals decision making performance instance ideal examination through sociology lens.accordingly would expect sociology influence largely macro areas management research.finally economics could characterized

indicating that disciplines management psychology remain discrete context management research. summary find little evidence that management literature represented engages interdisciplinary discussion moves forward. partial exception sociology which appears have disseminated more broadly within management literature.discussion conclusion almost years after influential reports recommended that business schools improve their intellectual climates develop closer relations with relevant underlying disciplines gordon howell pierson porter mckibbin undertook this study examine evolution research management.drawing insights from industry evolution literature theorized about trends citation patterns related disciplines management about relative impacts related disciplines dominant design that have emerged management.using citation analysis data from academy management journal found significant support maturing management discipline. internal stock knowledge discipline grown substantially consistently with this growth articles increasingly cite management research.interestingly impact related disciplines management research dominant design applying those disciplines differs between micro macro areas management research. micro area psychology clearly dominant discipline citations psychology journals exceed citations management journals citations economics sociology journals account less than percent total. contrast disciplinary impact macro area much more diverse with none related disciplines predominating.citations management journals macro area have been steadily increasing represent majority while citations economics psychology sociology journals have converged approximately percent each.perhaps even more striking results regarding correlations among disciplinary citation counts. trends indicate decline most cases increasingly negative likelihood multiple disciplines being represented same research article.thus when management researchers draw related disciplines seem discipline time.before moving implications findings important that acknowledge some limitations research.first analysis rests assumption that articles representative sample research management. extent that this assumption violated results differ from those more comprehensive analysis that includes articles published management discipline.second focus citations implied that could undertake network analysis disciplinary linkages type that biehl wade conducted links among journals included financial times ranking business schools. results interdisciplinary links would have been strengthened analysis inflows outflows knowledge represented pairwise links among related disciplines rather than represented links single management journal.another important limitation study that reliance citations quantitative analysis permit qualitative assessment impact that ideas within management from related disciplines have management research.although citations general correlate with impact ideas within discipline differences norms citations affect cross disciplinary comparisons. above limitations notwithstanding what these results indicate about state discipline management. offer some speculations.although signs maturity evidence that strong body management related knowledge developed encouraging results regarding cross disciplinary links some concern. applied discipline management does draw psychological economic sociological perspectives these perspectives used single specialized lenses. micro area economics sociology ignored.although case made that sociology relatively little offer individual small group level same cannot said economics which rich tradition examining issues related individuals within labor economics. primary focus micro research psychology alone related reduction industrial relations programs which traditionally interdisciplinary.absent integrated multidis university wisconsin university iowa example longer have industrial relations programs. agarwal hoetker ciplinary .programs costs boundary spanning become inordinately high since management students attempting span boundaries have master disciplinary courses more than department integrate multiple perspectives their .this state affairs result self reinforcing trend toward single discipline dominance.absent exposure economics through multidisciplinary program doctoral students later become management scholars micro area focus primarily psychology.this limitation also implications schools management recruiting micro researchers trained within economics less likely that search committee comprised primarily psychologists will hire micro researchers from relatively alien discipline. macro area although three source disciplines seem equally represented negative near zero correlations among them indicate once again that when perspective utilized others ignored.further lack subsequent citations research based discipline research based another seems suggest existence discipline based subgroups cliques scholars. result situation less troubling than what exists micro management research.indeed babelization macro management research mirrored trends whereby management departments specialize disciplinary foci.mcgrath discusses disturbing fact that management departments highly ranked universities prefer recruiting directly from disciplinary departments rather than from management give more weight publications disciplinary journals than those management journals their tenure deliberations. increased singularity disciplinary focus again self reinforcing recruiting tenure committees prefer hire faculty similar themselves thus causing parallel schools thought develop without benefit integration insights from another. part results mirror unease among researchers related disciplines themselves.much been written disciplinary journals regarding strained relationships between economics sociology baron hannan gimeno swedberg economics psychology lewin lichtenstein slovic smith .these articles highlight need examine underlying assumptions mainstream thought integrate different perspectives build theory alternative behavioral assumptions.such voicing dissonance have helped growth complexity issues examined within disciplines necessarily between them. example economics rational theories have make room behavioral ones with concurrent acknowledgement value offered sociology psychology lewin .cole pfeffer highlighted importance high level paradigm development within discipline since strong consensus theoretical methodological approaches enables more efficient communication permits interdependent activity continued growth creating positive feedback loop between paradigm development advancement knowledge.thus above example mainstream economics adaptation behavioral critiques from sociologists psychologists high level paradigm development have proved fruitful since disagreement resolved basis agreed upon ways resolving theoretical methodological disputes. mirroring such disciplinary conflicts management however have negative consequence continued evolution given level paradigm development pfeffer . adopting foundation reports recommendation that management look related disciplines improve intellectual climate research rigor management scholars have inadvertently done ourselves disservice.since multiple disciplines have relevance management have diluted paradigm development viewing field multidisciplinary tent which fundamentally theoretical perspective methodological approach valid other pfeffer . sure diversity thought just like diversity design valuable stages evolution industry discipline theories methodologies introduced scholars from related disciplines certainly provide value management continues evolve.however extent which value captured depends ability discipline assimilate relevant perspectives which itself relates whether consensus exists value disciplined integration multiple perspectives. important note that disciplined integration mean mixing potpourri ideas integration based systematic examination underlying differences assumptions central research questions relative lack attention tension between psychology sociology result little overlap their focal levels analysis. decemberacademy management journal orientations relevant ideas. other hand related source disciplines exist some disharmony with each other management more likely fragmented dissonant cause concern articulated pfeffer .when interpreted this light results suggesting that micro area research single disciplinary influence indicate that stronger paradigm development than macro area.this does however mean that micro researchers face less challenge than macro management researchers.within micro management research stronger core presence psychology enable assimilation insights from economics continued evolution micro area benefit from examination what economics offer. extent though that disciplinary perspectives represent fundamental differences values assumptions orientation these latter effects dominate paradigmatic consensus terms receptivity integrating economics into fold. contrast macro area research face different issues.this area needs better integration disciplinary perspectives rather than current multidisciplinary approach drawing only discipline time. lack strong paradigm development concern reasons explicated pfeffer . same time there better chance disciplined integration related disciplinary perspectives given that correlations among disciplines less negative even slightly positive.perhaps important resolve these problems would recall early motives founding business schools perceived need scholarship with practical relevance managers equipped deal with real world problems.management research create value when theory development been uniquely motivated challenges faced firms managers helfat mcgrath . motivated management research provide theoretical insights available from related disciplines alone. argue that advance management research merely enough conduct psychology sociology economics based research business setting.doing creates little value beyond that available particular related discipline.rather necessary connect disciplinary insights with those generated increasingly rich management discipline.beyond generating unique theoretical advances such combinations would help address major critique management research education that longer relates real business problems.unlike most other areas academic endeavor management research ultimately must provide requisite theory conceptual frameworks that help managing leading people business organizations alsop . atheoretical approach failed provide those frameworks partially triggering subsequent disciplinary focus.however that focus leads theoretical conceptual frameworks that inform those manage firms lead people management research will have failed equal degree. parallel found challenge teaching management.richard schmalensee dean sloan school management relates having former chairman jack welch teach class what talked about related theory taught other classes jack doesn make connection sure students either alsop emphasis added . paired welch with professor ensure that students made those connections similarly theoretically rigorous work from management discipline should combined with insights from other disciplines advance theory frameworks that advance practice management. elaboration this view descriptions other possible actions that bridge theory practice shapiro kirkman courtney . results suggest that early days process creating that integration. both micro macro realms management literature plays substantial role significantly paired with related disciplines. consistently weak correlation between psychology management micro realm suggests pairing rather distinct approaches based management literature other psychology. same situation exists although perhaps less extremely macro realm with neither economics sociology being highly integrated with management.with maturation management discipline field poised advance this integration.unfortunately although field would benefit collectively from this integration from clear that individuals would benefit from attempting .several challenges loom.first becoming increasingly difficult remain current discipline alone master multiple disciplines.junior faculty many ways best positioned they have often recently taken broad range courses.however demands promotion tenure process strongly discourage such investment their part. resulting inertia often persists even once tenure earned.secondly review process discourage this type integra agarwal hoetker tion.papers that utilize more than discipline need from multiple reviewers appreciate multiple perspectives. reward cost ratio individual scholar seems here because chances getting such unclear that there greater prestige such paper does successfully navigate review process. look forward next years research discipline then there much reason celebrate also more reason embrace challenges that face .management clearly evolved into distinct discipline greatly benefited from bonds with related disciplines. this juncture though also behooves management researchers examine these connections more closely ensure that they bind rather enable provide valuable insights regarding management practice. integrated disciplined approach toward disciplinary bonds will long achieving this objective. need cautious interact with related disciplines.certainly need welcome discipline based scholars with theoretical methodological insights that will strengthen research.however also need wary bondage singularity disciplinary focus that blind other useful perspectives.productive cautious interaction require management researchers whether they diversifying entrants from related disciplines novo entrants trained within move outside comfort zones grow through disciplined integration relevant perspectives. also require change journals conduct reviews that authors engage such boundary spanning meet with resistance from reviewers bound singular disciplinary foci.'"

represented engages interdisciplinary discussion moves forward. partial exception sociology which appears have disseminated more broadly within literature.discussion conclusion almost years after influential reports recommended that schools improve their intellectual climates develop closer relations with relevant underlying disciplines howell pierson porter mckibbin undertook this study examine evolution management.drawing insights from industry evolution literature theorized about trends citation patterns related disciplines about relative impacts related disciplines dominant that have emerged management.using citation analysis data from academy journal found significant support maturing discipline. internal stock knowledge discipline grown substantially consistently with this growth articles increasingly cite research.interestingly impact related disciplines dominant applying those disciplines differs between micro macro areas . micro area psychology clearly dominant discipline citations psychology journals exceed citations journals citations sociology journals account less than percent total. contrast disciplinary impact macro area much more diverse with related disciplines predominating.citations journals macro area have been steadily increasing represent majority while citations psychology sociology journals have converged approximately percent each.perhaps even more striking results regarding correlations among disciplinary citation counts. trends indicate decline most cases increasingly negative likelihood multiple disciplines being represented same article.thus when researchers draw related disciplines seem discipline time.before moving implications findings important that acknowledge some limitations research.first analysis rests assumption that articles representative sample . extent that this assumption violated results differ from those more comprehensive analysis that includes articles published discipline.second focus citations implied that could undertake network analysis disciplinary linkages type that biehl wade conducted links among journals included financial times ranking schools. results interdisciplinary links would have been strengthened analysis inflows outflows knowledge represented pairwise links among related disciplines rather than represented links single journal.another important limitation study that reliance citations quantitative analysis permit qualitative assessment impact that ideas within from related disciplines have research.although citations general correlate with impact ideas within discipline differences norms citations affect disciplinary comparisons. above limitations notwithstanding what these results indicate about state discipline . offer some speculations.although signs maturity evidence that strong body related knowledge developed encouraging results regarding disciplinary links some concern. discipline does draw psychological economic sociological perspectives these perspectives used single specialized lenses. micro area sociology ignored.although case made that sociology relatively little offer individual group level same cannot said which rich tradition examining issues related individuals within labor . primary focus micro psychology alone related reduction industrial relations programs which traditionally interdisciplinary.absent integrated multidis university wisconsin university iowa example longer have industrial relations programs. agarwal hoetker ciplinary .programs costs boundary spanning become inordinately high since students attempting span boundaries have master disciplinary courses more than department integrate multiple perspectives their .this state affairs result self reinforcing trend toward single discipline dominance.absent exposure through multidisciplinary program doctoral students later become scholars micro area focus primarily psychology.this limitation also implications schools recruiting micro researchers trained within less likely that search committee comprised primarily psychologists will hire micro researchers from relatively alien discipline. macro area although three source disciplines seem equally represented negative near zero correlations among them indicate once again that when perspective utilized others ignored.further lack subsequent citations based discipline based another seems suggest existence discipline based subgroups cliques scholars. result situation less troubling than what exists micro research.indeed babelization macro mirrored trends whereby departments specialize disciplinary foci.mcgrath discusses disturbing fact that departments highly ranked universities prefer recruiting directly from disciplinary departments rather than from give more weight publications disciplinary journals than those journals their tenure deliberations. increased singularity disciplinary focus again self reinforcing recruiting tenure committees prefer hire faculty similar themselves thus causing parallel schools thought develop without benefit integration insights from another. part results mirror unease among researchers related disciplines themselves.much been written disciplinary journals regarding strained relationships between sociology hannan gimeno swedberg psychology lewin lichtenstein slovic .these articles highlight need examine underlying assumptions mainstream thought integrate different perspectives build theory alternative behavioral assumptions.such voicing dissonance have helped growth complexity issues examined within disciplines necessarily between them. example rational theories have make room behavioral ones with concurrent acknowledgement value offered sociology psychology lewin .cole highlighted importance high level paradigm development within discipline since strong consensus theoretical methodological approaches enables more efficient communication permits interdependent activity continued growth creating positive feedback loop between paradigm development advancement knowledge.thus above example mainstream adaptation behavioral critiques from sociologists psychologists high level paradigm development have proved fruitful since disagreement resolved basis agreed upon ways resolving theoretical methodological disputes. mirroring such disciplinary conflicts however have negative consequence continued evolution given level paradigm development . adopting foundation reports recommendation that look related disciplines improve intellectual climate rigor scholars have inadvertently done ourselves disservice.since multiple disciplines have relevance have diluted paradigm development viewing multidisciplinary tent which fundamentally theoretical perspective methodological approach valid other . sure diversity thought just like diversity valuable stages evolution industry discipline theories methodologies introduced scholars from related disciplines certainly provide value continues evolve.however extent which value captured depends ability discipline assimilate relevant perspectives which itself relates whether consensus exists value disciplined integration multiple perspectives. important note that disciplined integration mean mixing potpourri ideas integration based systematic examination underlying differences assumptions central questions relative lack attention tension between psychology sociology result little overlap their focal levels analysis. decemberacademy journal orientations relevant ideas. other hand related source disciplines exist some disharmony with each other more likely fragmented dissonant cause concern articulated .when interpreted this light results suggesting that micro area single disciplinary influence indicate that stronger paradigm development than macro area.this does however mean that micro researchers face less challenge than macro researchers.within micro stronger core presence psychology enable assimilation insights from continued evolution micro area benefit from examination what offer. extent though that disciplinary perspectives represent fundamental differences values assumptions orientation these latter effects dominate paradigmatic consensus terms receptivity integrating into fold. contrast macro area face different issues.this area needs better integration disciplinary perspectives rather than current multidisciplinary approach drawing only discipline time. lack strong paradigm development concern reasons explicated . same time there better chance disciplined integration related disciplinary perspectives given that correlations among disciplines less negative even slightly positive.perhaps important resolve these problems would recall early motives founding schools perceived need scholarship with practical relevance managers equipped deal with real world problems.management create value when theory development been uniquely motivated challenges faced firms managers helfat . motivated provide theoretical insights available from related disciplines alone. argue that advance merely enough conduct psychology sociology based setting.doing creates little value beyond that available particular related discipline.rather necessary connect disciplinary insights with those generated increasingly rich discipline.beyond generating unique theoretical advances such combinations would help address major critique education that longer relates real problems.unlike most other areas academic endeavor ultimately must provide requisite theory conceptual frameworks that help managing leading people organizations alsop . atheoretical approach failed provide those frameworks partially triggering subsequent disciplinary focus.however that focus leads theoretical conceptual frameworks that inform those manage firms lead people will have failed equal degree. parallel found challenge teaching management.richard schmalensee sloan relates having former chairman welch teach class what talked about related theory taught other classes doesn make connection sure students either alsop emphasis added . paired welch with professor ensure that students made those connections similarly theoretically rigorous work from discipline should combined with insights from other disciplines advance theory frameworks that advance practice . elaboration this view descriptions other possible actions that bridge theory practice . results suggest that early days process creating that integration. both micro macro realms literature plays substantial role significantly paired with related disciplines. consistently weak correlation between psychology micro realm suggests pairing rather distinct approaches based literature other psychology. same situation exists although perhaps less extremely macro realm with neither sociology being highly integrated with management.with maturation discipline poised advance this integration.unfortunately although would benefit collectively from this integration from clear that individuals would benefit from attempting .several challenges loom.first becoming increasingly difficult remain current discipline alone master multiple disciplines.junior faculty many ways positioned they have often recently taken broad range courses.however demands promotion tenure process strongly discourage such investment their part. resulting inertia often persists even once tenure earned.secondly review process discourage this type integra agarwal hoetker tion.papers that utilize more than discipline need from multiple reviewers appreciate multiple perspectives. reward cost ratio individual scholar seems here because chances getting such unclear that there greater prestige such paper does successfully navigate review process. look forward next years discipline then there much reason celebrate also more reason embrace challenges that face .management clearly evolved into distinct discipline greatly benefited from bonds with related disciplines. this juncture though also behooves researchers examine these connections more closely ensure that they bind rather enable provide valuable insights regarding practice. integrated disciplined approach toward disciplinary bonds will achieving this objective. need cautious interact with related disciplines.certainly need welcome discipline based scholars with theoretical methodological insights that will strengthen research.however also need wary bondage singularity disciplinary focus that blind other useful perspectives.productive cautious interaction require researchers whether they diversifying entrants from related disciplines novo entrants trained within move outside comfort zones grow through disciplined integration relevant perspectives. also require change journals conduct reviews that authors engage such boundary spanning meet with resistance from reviewers bound singular disciplinary foci.'"
