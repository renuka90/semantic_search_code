datta, guthrie, & wright, 2005; \\nsun, aryee, & law, 2007; wright, gardner, \\nmoynihan, & allen, 2005). efforts to unlock \\nthe “black box” between hrm interventions \\nand performance outcomes have led to a \\nnumber of studies that explore the mediating \\nrole played by either employee attitudes such \\nas job satisfaction and commitment, behav-\\n\\niors such as task performance and \\norganizational citizenship behav-\\nior (ocb), or experienced organi-\\nzational practices such as perceived \\norganizational support, organiza-\\ntional justice, or job design \\n(kuvaas, 2008; snape & redman, \\n2010; sun et al., 2007). most re-\\ncent studies situate their analyses \\nwithin the framework of social \\nexchange theory, arguing that or-\\nganizational hrm practices send \\novert and implicit signals to em-\\nployees about the extent to which \\nthey are valued and trusted, giving \\nrise to feelings of obligation on the \\npart of employees, who then recip-\\nrocate through high levels of per-\\nformance (allen, shore, & griffeth, \\n2003; gould-williams, 2007; \\npurcell & hutchinson, 2007). \\n\\nalthough substantial progress \\nhas been made, there are several \\nareas where research evidence \\nremains limited. first, although \\nit has been argued that the role of \\nline managers as agents in imple-\\nmenting hrm practices is fun-\\ndamental to understanding how \\nemployees interpret and respond \\nto their employer’s hrm system \\n(holt larsen & brewster, 2003), \\nstudies that examine the line \\nmanager role alongside hrm pol-\\nicy and practice remain rare (den \\n\\nhartog, boselie, & paauwe, 2004; tekleab & \\ntaylor, 2003). \\n\\nsecond, few studies have used mea-\\nsures of perceived hrm practices from the \\nemployee perspective, yet it has been shown \\nthat intended, implemented, and perceived \\nhrm practices differ substantially (conway \\n& monks, 2008; gratton & truss, 2003; snape \\n& redman, 2010).\\n\\nthird, most studies have focused on a \\nrelatively restricted range of potential media-\\ntors, such as affective commitment or ocb \\n(allen et al., 2003; snape & redman, 2010). \\nthe hrm-performance literature has there-\\nfore overlooked developments in other, \\nrelated areas and specifically evidence link-\\ning levels of employee engagement with \\nindividual performance (christian, garza, & \\nslaughter, 2011; kahn, 1990; rich, lepine, & \\ncrawford, 2010; saks, 2006; truss et al., 2006). \\nthe multi-factorial psychological construct of \\nemployee engagement, originally defined by \\nkahn (1990) as the harnessing of individuals’ \\nselves to their role performance on physical, \\ncognitive, and emotional levels, represents an \\nalternative and conceptually promising factor \\nthat is increasingly used as a mediator linking \\na range of workplace phenomena as demon-\\nstrated in a recent meta-analysis by christian \\net al. (2011). \\n\\nfourth, it has been argued that aggregate \\noutcome variables used in the extant litera-\\nture, such as firm financial performance and \\norganizational effectiveness, are too distal \\nfrom the micro-level of hrm interventions, \\nand that more proximal outcome indicators \\nat the individual level would provide a bet-\\nter and more reliable measure (paauwe, 2004; \\npurcell & kinnie, 2007; wright & haggerty, \\n2005). a further consideration is that a focus \\non purely short-term financial gains may \\nbe at the expense of potentially desirable \\nlonger-term outcomes, such as sustainabil-\\nity and resilience at the organizational level, \\nand well-being at the individual level (e.g., \\nboxall & purcell, 2008; guest, 2002; ramsay, \\nscholarios, & harley, 2000). there is a case \\nto be made for focusing on attitudinal or \\nbehavioral outcomes at the individual level, \\nwhere the link between experiences of hrm \\npractices and a range of outcomes is more \\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 841\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nproximal, and which may be considered to be \\nan intermediary outcome and core driver of \\noverall organizational performance (wright \\n& haggerty, 2005). however, very few stud-\\nies have focused on behavioral outcomes at \\nall (ostroff & bowen, 2000; snape & redman, \\n2010; takeuchi, 2009), or examined the link \\nbetween employee experiences of hrm and \\nbehavioral outcomes such as individual per-\\nformance, aside from intent to quit (allen, \\n2006; conway & monks, 2009). \\n\\nto address these various limitations in \\nthe existing literature, we examine the rela-\\ntionship between perceived line manager \\nbehavior, perceived hrm practices, and the \\nindividual-level outcomes of self-report task \\nperformance and self-report innovative work \\nbehavior, exploring the role of employee \\nengagement as a mediating construct. using \\na social exchange framework, we argue that \\nemployee experiences of hrm practices inter-\\nact with perceived line manager behavior to \\nimpact on levels of employee engagement \\nand individual performance (figure 1). we \\ntest our model through structural equation \\nmodeling on questionnaire data obtained \\nfrom two studies involving service-sector \\norganizations in the united kingdom.\\n\\nperceived hrm, perceived line \\nmanager behavior, and \\nemployee engagement\\nprevious researchers have argued that com-\\nplementary sets of hrm practices, rather than \\n\\nindividual hrm practices, can lead to higher \\nlevels of organizational performance (combs, \\nyongmei, hall, & ketchen, 2006; takeuchi, \\n2009). these bundles of hrm practices, com-\\nmonly referred to as high-performance hrm \\npractices, are built on the notion that indi-\\nvidual experiences of clusters of hrm prac-\\ntices shape employees’ beliefs about the na-\\nture of the exchange relationship they enter \\ninto with their organization (rousseau & \\ngreller, 1994). hence, in order to assess the \\nimpact of hrm, the entire system of hrm \\npractices rather than individual practices \\nshould be taken into account (wright & \\nboswell, 2002). a consensus is emerging that \\nhigh-performance hrm practices are broadly \\nfocused around three areas (conway, 2004; \\nwright & boswell, 2002): (1) employee skills, \\nincluding selective recruitment; (2) motiva-\\ntion, including such practices as performance-\\nbased rewards; and (3) empowerment, includ-\\ning participation mechanisms (snape & \\nredman, 2010). most commentators argue \\nthat these act synergistically. snape and \\nredman (2010, p. 4) define such an hrm sys-\\ntem as consisting of “interconnected hr ac-\\ntivities, designed to ensure that employees \\nhave a broad range of superior skills and abili-\\nties, which are utilized to achieve the organi-\\nzation’s goals.” in the present study, we there-\\nfore aim to assess how employees’ overall \\npositive perceptions of high-performance \\nhrm practices will be related to their behav-\\nior such as task performance and innovative \\nwork behavior.\\n\\nfigure 1.  model linking perceived line manager behavior and \\nperceived hrm practices to individual performance\\n\\nperceived\\n\\nhrm\\n\\npractices\\n\\nemployee\\n\\nengagement\\n\\n•  self-report task\\n\\n   performance\\n\\n•  self-report\\n\\n   innovative work\\n\\n   behavior\\n\\nperceived\\n\\nline manager\\n\\nbehavior\\n\\n\\n\\n842 , november–december 2013\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nalthough most researchers have argued \\nthat certain hrm approaches can drive up \\norganizational performance (batt, 2002; datta \\net al., 2005; huselid, 1995; som, 2008), oth-\\ners have been more circumspect (den hartog \\net al., 2004; gooderham, parry, & ringdal, \\n2008; guest, michie, conway, & sheehan, \\n2003; truss, 2001). while large-scale surveys \\nof senior hrm practitioners have helped to \\ndevelop a broad understanding of relevant \\nhrm factors, a focus on hrm as intended by \\nthe employer may not capture employees’ \\nlived experiences of hrm, which arguably \\nare more relevant in the hrm-performance \\nchain (wright & boswell, 2002; wright & \\nhaggerty, 2005). studies have in fact found \\nthat the links between intended, imple-\\nmented, and perceived hrm strategies are \\npoor, due to variability in implementation \\nand diverse individual-level cognitive sche-\\nmas (edgar & geare, 2005; khilji & wang, \\n2006; kuvaas, 2008; wright & haggerty, \\n2005). however, research that focuses on the \\nperceived hrm-performance linkage is rare. \\nas nishii, lepak, and schneider (2008, p. \\n504) argue: “[e]mpirical research that begins \\nto explore the role of employees’ perceptions \\nof hrm practices in the causal chain is sorely \\nneeded.” we respond to this call by focusing \\nour attention on employee experiences of \\nhrm practices, rather than simply intended \\nhrm strategies. in doing so, we build upon \\ntwo earlier studies. first, in an investigation \\ninvolving 215 salespeople in a department \\nstore and 197 insurance agents, allen et al. \\n(2003) showed that perceptions of support-\\nive hrm practices—such as participation, \\nreward fairness, and growth opportunities—\\ncontributed to the development of perceived \\norganizational support, which mediated \\ntheir relationship with job satisfaction and \\norganizational commitment and showed a \\nnegative relationship with turnover. second, \\nconway and monks (2009) studied 288 \\nemployees in three irish financial services \\nfirms and found that attitudes toward hrm \\npractices had a greater impact on affective \\nthan on other forms of commitment, regard-\\nless of context, and also established links \\nbetween perceived hrm practices, intent to \\nquit, and job satisfaction.\\n\\nwhile early studies tended to propose a \\ndirect link between hrm and organizational \\nperformance, recent evidence suggests that \\nthe relationship is most likely mediated by \\na range of attitudinal and behavioral vari-\\nables at the individual level, particularly job \\nsatisfaction, affective and continuance com-\\nmitment, task performance, and ocb (den \\nhartog et al., 2004; guest, conway, & dewe, \\n2004; kinnie, hutchinson, purcell, rayton, & \\nswart, 2005; kuvaas, 2008; snape & redman, \\n2010; takeuchi, 2009).\\n\\nstudies of mediation often draw on social \\nexchange theory to provide an explanatory \\nframework. social exchange theory is based on \\nnorms of reciprocity within social relationships \\n(blau, 1964; emerson, 1976). it is argued that \\nemployees are motivated within the employ-\\nment relationship to demonstrate positive \\nattitudes and behaviors when they perceive \\nthat their employer values them and their \\ncontribution (cropanzano, rupp, & byrne, \\n2003; kuvaas & dysvik, 2010; wayne, shore, \\n& liden, 1997). certain hrm practices may \\nbe viewed as signaling an intent for long-term \\ninvestment in employees that obliges them to \\nreciprocate with discretionary role behavior \\nand contributions (gong, chang, & cheung, \\n2010; shaw, dineen, fang, & vellella, 2009; \\nsun et al., 2007). as hannah and iverson (2002, \\np. 339) note: “hrm practices are viewed by \\nemployees as a ‘personalized’ commitment to \\nthem by the organization which is then recip-\\nrocated back to the organization by employees \\nthrough positive attitudes and behavior.”\\n\\nalthough social exchange theory has \\nproven a useful lens through which to view \\nthe relationship between hrm practices and \\norganizational performance, evidence con-\\ncerning the mediating effects of the proposed \\nrange of attitudes and behaviors has so far \\nproved contradictory. for example, while \\nsun et al. (2007) showed that ocb partially \\nmediates the relationship between high-per-\\nformance hrm practices and organizational \\nperformance, kuvaas (2008) found no evi-\\ndence of the mediating effects of affective \\ncommitment in the link between develop-\\nmental hrm practices and individual per-\\nformance, and snape and redman’s (2010) \\nfindings on mediation were inconclusive.\\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 843\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nthere is therefore no consistent evidence \\nas to which mediators are most relevant, nor \\nhow they operate within mediated models. \\nfor example, it could be argued that the pro-\\nposed attitudinal mediators of job satisfac-\\ntion and commitment have no immediate \\nrelevance to individual performance (judge, \\nbono, thoresen, & patton, 2001), as borne out \\nby conway and monks’s (2009) study. ocb \\nclearly is relevant for individual performance, \\nbut the focus is on extra-role rather than \\nwithin-role performance, and a case could \\nbe made that employees’ task performance \\nis equally important. there would therefore \\nappear to be scope to search for an alterna-\\ntive, and possibly more relevant, mediator. in \\norder to address this point, we introduce the \\nconcept of employee engagement as a poten-\\ntially significant mediating variable.\\n\\nthe construct of employee engagement \\nwas first proposed by kahn (1990) to signify \\nthe expression of self in-role, involving physi-\\ncal, cognitive, and emotional dimensions, \\nand has since been the focus of extensive the-\\noretical and empirical research (alfes, truss, \\nsoane, rees, & gatenby, 2010; christian et al., \\n2011; macey & schneider, 2008; may, gilson, \\n& harter, 2004; rich et al., 2010; rothbard, \\n2001; truss et al., 2006). engagement is con-\\nceived as a multi-factorial behavioral, atti-\\ntudinal, and affective individual differences \\nvariable (macey & schneider, 2008; may \\net al., 2004; rich et al., 2010). researchers have \\nargued that engagement differs from other \\nattitudinal and behavioral constructs, includ-\\ning those most commonly used as mediators \\nin many hrm practice studies: commitment, \\njob satisfaction, and ocb. engagement is \\nseen as more than job satisfaction, since it \\nimplies activation and not merely satiation \\n(macey & schneider, 2008). equally, it differs \\nfrom commitment, which is merely attitudi-\\nnal, in that engagement additionally implies \\nattentiveness to work and absorption in its \\nperformance (saks, 2006). engagement has \\nsome associations with discretionary effort \\nand ocb (campbell & pritchard, 1976), but \\nadditionally refers purely to someone’s state \\nof mind in, and behavior in relation to, the \\nperformance of their formal work role, while \\nocb is concerned with extra-role activities \\n\\n(bateman & organ, 1983; griffin, parker, & \\nneal, 2008; macey & schneider, 2008). \\n\\nthere have been no prior studies examin-\\ning whether there is a link between hrm, or \\nperceived hrm, and engagement. however, it \\nwould be reasonable to extrapolate, from the \\nstudies referred to earlier that have established \\na link between perceived hrm practices and a \\nvariety of other attitudinal or behavioral con-\\nstructs, that perceived hrm practices may be \\nlinked with employee engagement. this gives \\nrise to our first hypothesis:\\n\\nhypothesis 1: perceived hrm practices are posi-\\ntively related to employee engagement.\\n\\nprior research has also acknowledged \\nthat line managers have a significant role to \\nplay in the hrm-performance chain (bredin \\n& söderlund, 2007; den hartog et al., 2004; \\nkuvaas & dysvik, 2010; purcell & hutchinson, \\n2007). they signal to employees the value \\nplaced upon them by the employer, both \\nin terms of the way they implement hrm \\npractices and through their leadership style \\n(den hartog et al., 2004; mcgovern, gratton, \\nhope hailey, stiles, & truss, 1997; snape & \\nredman, 2010). as purcell and hutchinson \\n(2007, p. 6) note, line manager behavior “has \\nto be included in any causal chain seeking to \\nexplain and measure the relationship between \\nhrm and organizational performance.”\\n\\nin a multinational study, holt larsen \\nand brewster (2003) showed that line man-\\nagers are taking on increasing responsibil-\\nity for hrm implementation. there have \\nbeen a small number of previous studies on \\nthe role of line managers in implementing \\nhrm. for example, in an exploratory study \\ninvolving structured interviews in 12 orga-\\nnizations, purcell and hutchinson (2007) \\nfound a symbiotic relationship for employees \\nbetween hrm and front-line manager behav-\\nior. kuvaas and dysvik (2010), in a study of \\n331 employees in a norwegian telecoms com-\\npany, similarly found that perceived invest-\\nment in employee development only led to \\nincreased work effort, work quality, and ocb \\nwhen associated with high levels of perceived \\nsupervisor support. equally, kuvaas (2008) \\nshowed that employees can only respond \\n\\n\\n\\n844 , november–december 2013\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\npositively to developmental hrm initia-\\ntives when there is a high-quality employee-\\norganization relationship in place. \\n\\nwhile some prior studies have therefore \\nsuggested that perceived line manager behav-\\nior interacts with hrm practices in their impact \\non individual-level outcomes, a separate body \\nof research has similarly shown that perceived \\nline manager behavior can act as an anteced-\\nent to engagement (bates, 2004; de mello e \\nsouza wildermuth & pauken, 2008; frank, \\nfinnegan, & taylor, 2004). line managers \\ncan foster trust relationships between them-\\nselves and their direct reports, for example, \\nthrough encouraging open communication, \\nsharing critical information, and providing \\nsupport (settoon, bennett, & liden, 1996). \\nthis, in turn, will lead to positive emotional \\nstates and higher levels of employee engage-\\nment (avolio, gardner, walumbwa, luthans, \\n& may, 2004). for instance, robinson, \\nperryman, and hayday (2004) showed how \\nincreased opportunities for upward feed-\\nback led to higher levels of engagement, and \\nblizzard (2003) demonstrated that effective \\ninterpersonal relationships between employ-\\nees and managers raised engagement levels. \\nthis gives rise to our second hypothesis:\\n\\nhypothesis 2: perceived line manager behavior is \\npositively related to employee engagement.\\n\\nstudies of engagement, like those of high-\\nperformance hrm practices, draw on social \\nexchange theory to suggest that employees \\nwill become engaged with their work when \\nantecedents are in place that signal to them \\nthat they are valued and trusted (rich et al., \\n2010; saks, 2006). although no research has \\nexamined the link between hrm practices \\nand engagement, empirical studies have \\ndemonstrated a link between high levels of \\nengagement and the same outcomes as the \\nhigh-performance hrm practices literature. \\nengaged employees invest themselves fully \\nin their roles (rothbard, 2001), which may \\nlead to the enactment of active in-role per-\\nformances (ho, wong, & lee, 2011; macey \\n& schneider, 2008). engaged employees may \\nachieve higher performance because they \\nfocus their efforts on work-related goals, are \\n\\ncognitively vigilant, and are emotionally and \\nsocially connected to their work (kahn, 1990). \\nsince engaged employees feel more spirited, \\nthey can accomplish their in-role tasks with \\nless effort (hockey, 2000), and additionally \\ninvest time and resources in seeking new \\nways of delivering their work or changing and \\nimproving their environment (ramamoorthy, \\nflood, slattery, & sardessai, 2005).\\n\\nthese findings have been supported by \\nfurther recent studies. in a study of 245 fire-\\nfighters, rich et al. (2010) found that engage-\\nment mediated the relationship between \\nvalue congruence, perceived organizational \\nsupport, core self-evaluations, task perfor-\\nmance, and ocb, while sonnentag (2003) \\ndemonstrated that engagement leads to pro-\\nactive behavior, initiative taking, and the \\npursuit of learning goals. these findings are \\nconsistent with christian et al.’s (2011) meta-\\nanalysis, which found support for a mediat-\\ning effect of engagement on the relationship \\nbetween job characteristics, leadership, per-\\nsonal traits, task performance, and ocb. this \\nleads to our final set of hypotheses:\\n\\nhypothesis 3a: employee engagement is positively \\nrelated to task performance and mediates the re-\\nlationship between perceived hrm practices and \\ntask performance.\\n\\nhypothesis 3b: employee engagement is positively \\nrelated to innovative work behavior and mediates \\nthe relationship between perceived hrm practices \\nand innovative work behavior.\\n\\nhypothesis 4a: employee engagement is positively \\nrelated to task performance and mediates the rela-\\ntionship between perceived line manager behavior \\nand task performance.\\n\\nhypothesis 4b: employee engagement is positively \\nrelated to innovative work behavior and mediates \\nthe relationship between perceived line manager \\nbehavior and innovative work behavior.\\n\\nmethods\\n\\noverview of the research process\\n\\nwe employed a cross-sectional research design \\nin two case study organizations operating in \\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 845\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nwe employed a \\n\\ncross-sectional \\n\\nresearch design \\n\\nin two case study \\n\\norganizations \\n\\noperating in the \\n\\nservice sector in the \\n\\nunited kingdom.\\n\\nthe service sector in the united kingdom \\n(bryman & bell, 2007). this methodology was \\nchosen because we were interested in explor-\\ning the patterns of associations within organi-\\nzational settings between perceived hrm \\npractices and line manager behavior, and \\ntheir relationship with engagement and self-\\nreport individual performance. we used a \\nquestionnaire survey of employees in both \\norganizations, which enabled us to gather \\ndata on the constructs of interest from a vari-\\nety of employees in each organization. the \\ncases were chosen as they were fairly similar \\nwith regard to the range of different staff em-\\nployed, their size, and the sector they were \\noperating in. both online and paper versions \\nof the questionnaire were created and admin-\\nistered by the authors, and sent to a selection \\nof employees with and without internet ac-\\ncess. in both organizations employees were \\nselected in collaboration with the hr man-\\nager to ensure that the sample was representa-\\ntive of the whole workforce. employees were \\ninformed about the purpose of the study and \\nits confidentiality, and encouraged to partici-\\npate in the survey within two weeks. in both \\norganizations, employees were given time to \\ncomplete the questionnaire during work. \\nwhile the online responses were stored on a \\nsecure server, the paper questionnaires were \\nreturned directly to the researchers to ensure \\nconfidentiality. for study 1, we analyzed the \\nrelationships between perceived line manager \\nbehavior, perceived hrm practices, employee \\nengagement, and self-report task perfor-\\nmance. for study 2, we examined those rela-\\ntionships with self-report innovative work \\nbehavior as a dependent variable. \\n\\nsamples\\n\\norganization a is a support services partner \\nin the united kingdom providing business \\nsolutions for clients across the local govern-\\nment, transport, education, and defense sec-\\ntors. a total of 2,500 employees from differ-\\nent locations were asked to take part in the \\nsurvey. from this sample, 1,157 question-\\nnaires were returned. listwise deletion of \\nmissing data led to a usable sample of 924 \\nrespondents, a response rate of 37 percent. \\n\\nthe sample comprised 72.5 percent men; the \\naverage age was 40.79 years (sd = 12.15); and \\nthe average tenure was 4.04 years (sd = 4.11). \\nrespondents were from different levels in \\ntheir organization and represented a range of \\noccupational backgrounds, including profes-\\nsionals (51.6 percent); administration (10.7 \\npercent); managers or senior officials (14.9 \\npercent); retail, customer, and personal ser-\\nvices (2.3 percent); skilled trades (5.9 percent); \\nmachine operators (8.5 percent); and elemen-\\ntary occupations (6.1 percent). \\n\\norganization b is a recycling and waste \\nmanagement company. the sample com-\\nprised 2,217 employees, ensuring an accu-\\nrate representation of workforce population. \\na total of 1,153 questionnaires \\nwere completed. listwise dele-\\ntion of missing data led to a \\nusable sample of 872 respondents, \\nwhich resulted in a slightly higher \\nresponse rate of 39 percent. there \\nwere 25.9 percent female respon-\\ndents within this sample. the \\naverage age was 41.42 years (sd \\n= 11.56), and the average tenure \\nwas 5.92 years (sd = 5.72). again, \\nthe respondents represented dif-\\nferent levels in the organization and \\ndiverse occupational backgrounds \\nincluding professionals (12.3 per-\\ncent);

and \\nelementary occupations (5.0 percent).\\n\\nmeasures\\n\\nperceived hrm practices\\n\\nperceived hrm practices were measured \\nbased upon gould-williams and davies’s \\n(2005) hrm practices scale. this was chosen \\nas it has been found to demonstrate high reli-\\nability and validity in previous studies of \\nhigh-performance hrm systems (gould-\\nwilliams, 2003; gould-williams & davies, \\n2005), but at the same time is of a reasonable \\nlength to be included in an employee survey \\n\\n\\n\\n846 , november–december 2013\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nincluding different occupational groups. \\nspecifically, we asked employees to assess six \\nhrm practices identified by the high-perfor-\\nmance hrm practices literature—namely, the \\nselection process, training opportunities, re-\\nwards systems, career management, develop-\\nment opportunities, and feedback mecha-\\nnisms. a sample item was “i am provided \\nwith sufficient opportunities for training and \\ndevelopment.” the response scale ranged \\nfrom 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly \\nagree”). the alphas were 0.83 for organization \\na and 0.85 for organization b.\\n\\nperceived line manager behavior\\n\\nperceived line manager behavior was measured \\nusing four items derived from cook and wall \\n(1980) and unden (1996). the items asked for \\nemployee perceptions of the effectiveness, eq-\\nuity, and integrity of their line manager. a sam-\\nple item was “i think my line manager is fair in \\nhis/her treatment of me.” the response scale \\nranged from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 \\n(“strongly agree”). the alphas were 0.93 for \\norganization a and 0.94 for organization b.\\n\\nemployee engagement\\n\\nwe measured engagement using a scale devel-\\noped by soane et al. (2012). the scale was \\nchosen because it operationalizes kahn’s \\n(1990) original conceptualization of engage-\\nment as the extent to which employees invest \\nthemselves fully in their role by establishing \\nmeaningful connections to others, and expe-\\nriencing positive cognitive and emotional re-\\nactions to the task. in line with the multidi-\\nmensional nature of engagement, the scale \\nencompasses three subscales of engagement. \\nintellectual engagement focuses on the extent \\nto which employees are cognitively involved \\nin their work. there were three items (e.g., “i \\nget completely absorbed in my work”). \\naffective engagement measures the extent to \\nwhich employees are emotionally involved \\nwith, and attached to, their work. there were \\nthree items, including “i am happy when i do \\na good job.” social engagement was assessed \\nwith three items and measures the extent to \\nwhich employees talk to their colleagues \\n\\nabout how to improve their work. items in-\\ncluded “i talk to people at work about how to \\nimprove the way i do my job.” response op-\\ntions ranged from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 \\n(“strongly agree”) for all subscales. because we \\nwere interested in an overall measure of en-\\ngagement, the three subscales were aggregated \\nto form an overall measure of engagement, \\nresulting in alpha values of 0.81 for \\norganization a and 0.86 for organization b.\\n\\nindividual task performance\\n\\na five-item scale from janssen and van yperen \\n(2004) was used to assess individual task per-\\nformance. we slightly altered the wording of \\nthe original scale to reflect the fact that em-\\nployees were asked to self-rate their perfor-\\nmance. a sample item was “i always complete \\nthe duties specified in my job description.” \\nthe response scale ranged from 1 (“strongly \\ndisagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). the alpha \\nwas 0.81 for organization a.\\n\\ninnovative work behavior\\n\\nwe measured innovative work behavior with \\na five-item scale based on janssen and van \\nyperen (2004). similarly to task performance, \\nwe changed the wording of the original items \\nto enable employees to self-rate their innova-\\ntive work behavior. a sample item was \\n“transforming innovative ideas into useful \\napplications.” the response scale ranged from \\n1 (“never”) to 5 (“daily”). the alpha was 0.96 \\nfor organization b.\\n\\nthe difficulties in gaining individual-\\nlevel performance data have been thoroughly \\ndiscussed in previous literature (huselid & \\nday, 1991; mannheim, baruch, & tal, 1997). \\nwe took additional steps to limit problems \\nassociated with common method variance as \\ndescribed next.\\n\\ndata analysis\\n\\nbecause all our variables were collected from \\na single source only, we had to deal with two \\nconcerns prior to proceeding to hypothesis \\ntesting: common method variance and dis-\\ncriminant validity. \\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 847\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nto examine and control for the influ-\\nence of common method bias in our study, \\nwe performed a series of confirmatory factor \\nanalyses (cfa) on both datasets. following \\nestablished recommendations (hair, black, \\nbabin, anderson, & tatham, 2005) we cal-\\nculated five fit indices to determine how \\nthe model fitted our data: χ2, goodness of \\nfit index (gfi), comparative fit index (cfi), \\nroot mean square error of approximation \\n(rmsea), and standardized root mean square \\nresidual (srmr). for gfi and cfi, values \\ngreater than .9 represent a good model fit, \\nand for srmr and rmsea, values less than \\n.07 indicate a good model fit (hu & bentler, \\n1998; kline, 2005).\\n\\nwe initially performed a cfa on the full \\nmeasurement model (anderson & gerbing, \\n1988) including all latent variables. overall, \\nthe measurement models exhibited good psy-\\nchometric properties (organization a: χ2 = \\n407, df = 129, gfi = .95, srmr = .04, rmsea \\n= .05, cfi = .96; organization b: χ2 = 379, \\ndf = 129, gfi = .95, srmr = .04, rmsea = \\n.05, cfi = .98) and all standardized regres-\\nsions coefficients in the measurement mod-\\nels were significant at the 0.001 level. to test \\nfor common method variance, we then con-\\nducted harman’s single-factor test (podsakoff, \\nmackenzie, jeong-yeon, & podsakoff, 2003), \\nwhich involves a cfa where all variables are \\nallowed to load onto one general factor. the \\nmodel exhibited very poor fit for both organi-\\nzations (organization a: χ2 = 3,595, df = 135, \\ngfi = .56, srmr = .15, rmsea = .17, cfi = \\n.44; organization b: χ2 = 6,973, df = 135, gfi \\n= .44, srmr = .21, rmsea = .24, cfi = .41), \\nwhich provided a good indication that a sin-\\ngle factor did not account for the majority of \\nvariance in our data.\\n\\nadditionally, we conducted a second test \\nas recommended by podsakoff et al. (2003), \\nintroducing an unmeasured latent methods \\nfactor to our original measurement model \\nallowing all items to load on their theoretical \\nconstructs, as well as on the latent methods \\nfactor. a comparison of both models revealed \\nthat including the method factor in the model \\nsignificantly improved the overall fit of the \\nmodel (organization a: δχ2(df) = 80(12); \\norganization b: δχ2 (df)= 40(12)). however, \\n\\nthe χ2 difference test is distributed χ2, and \\nresearchers argue that χ2 values are very sen-\\nsitive to large sample sizes and a high num-\\nber of observed variables, leading to biased \\nresults (bentler, 1990; bentler & bonett, 1980; \\nbollen, 1989; hair et al., 2005; hu & bentler, \\n1995; kline, 2005). we therefore assessed the \\nchange of cfi values for both models as an \\nindicator of significance as recommended \\nby byrne (2001). the change of cfi between \\nboth models was 0.02 for organization a and \\n0.03 for organization b, which is below the \\nsuggested rule of thumb of 0.05 (bagozzi & \\nyi, 1990). \\n\\nto determine whether the constructs in \\nour model were distinct from each other, we \\nperformed a test of the scales’ discriminant \\nvalidity following fornell and larcker (1981). \\nwe first calculated the average variance \\nextracted for each scale variable. according \\nto fornell and larcker (1981), scale variables \\nare sufficiently different from one another if \\na scale’s average variance extracted is greater \\nthan its shared variance with any other scale \\nvariable in the model. this condition was \\nmet in both datasets, and we concluded that \\nall scales were distinct from one another. the \\nvalues are portrayed along the diagonals of \\ntables i and iii, together with interscale cor-\\nrelations and descriptive statistics for all scale \\nvariables in both organizations.\\n\\nresults—study 1\\n\\ndescriptive statistics\\n\\ntable i presents the means and standard de-\\nviations for each scale, and interscale correla-\\ntions, for all study variables for organization \\na. the interscale correlations show the ex-\\npected direction of association and are all sig-\\nnificant at the p < .01 level. specifically, per-\\nceived hrm practices are positively related to \\nperceived line manager behavior (r = .52). \\nmoreover, employee engagement is positively \\nassociated with perceived hrm practices \\n(r = .35), perceived line manager behavior (r \\n= .34), and self-report task performance (r = \\n.32). the relationships between perceived

of hypotheses\\n\\nwe employed latent variable structural equa-\\ntion modeling (jöreskog & sörbom, 1993) \\nusing maximum likelihood estimation in \\namos 18.0 (arbuckle, 2006) to evaluate our \\nmodel. structural equation modeling simul-\\ntaneously estimates the structure within a se-\\nries of dependent relationships between la-\\ntent variables with multiple indicators, while \\ncorrecting for measurement errors (bollen & \\nlong, 1993; hair et al., 2005). this approach \\nseemed the most appropriate for testing our \\nempirical model. given that perceptions of \\nhrm practices and line manager behavior are \\nlikely to be positively associated, both con-\\nstructs were allowed to correlate in the struc-\\ntural model. overall, the model provided a \\ngood fit for our data (χ2 = 414, df = 131, gfi \\n= .95, srmr = .05, rmsea = .05, cfi = .96). \\n\\nas the sample in organization a consists \\nof a diverse range of employees, we carried out \\nmultigroup analyses to test for the reliability \\n\\nof our proposed model across different gen-\\nders, age groups, and hierarchical levels. our \\nresults1 showed that although there were dif-\\nferences with regard to the strength of the \\nassociation between the groups, we did not \\nfind any significant differences with regard to \\nthe overall model proposed. we therefore con-\\ncluded that the proposed model was a consis-\\ntent reflection of the relationships between \\nperceived hrm, perceived line manager \\nbehavior, employee engagement, and self-\\nreport performance within organization a. \\n\\nour hypothesized model implied that \\nengagement mediates the link between the \\nantecedents of engagement and self-report \\ntask performance. to analyze whether media-\\ntion according to baron and kenny (1986) \\ncould be found in our model, we examined \\nwhether an alternative model would lead to \\na significant improvement in the model fit \\ncompared to our hypothesized model by test-\\ning a series of nested models (anderson & \\ngerbing, 1988; mayer & davis, 1999). table \\nii presents the fit statistics for three alterna-\\ntive models compared to our

behavior, together \\nwith employees’ experiences of hrm prac-\\ntices, affect levels of employee engagement \\nand, further, how the relationship between \\nhrm practices, perceived line manager \\nbehavior, and individual performance is me-\\ndiated through engagement. we thereby re-\\nsponded to calls for studies analyzing the role \\nof line managers in the hrm-performance \\nchain (guest, 2011; purcell & hutchinson, \\n2007). data from 1,796 employees in two or-\\nganizations largely supported our theoretical \\nframework. in both organizations, perceived \\nhrm practices were positively associated with \\nemployee engagement (β = .31), lending sup-\\nport to hypothesis 1. furthermore, perceived \\nline manager behavior was positively associ-\\nated with engagement in both organizations \\n(β = .25 and .26), supporting hypothesis 2. \\nmoreover, perceptions of hrm practices and \\n\\nline manager behavior were positively corre-\\nlated, supporting the notion of a joint effect \\non individual levels of engagement (r = .57 \\nand .54). engagement, in turn, led to higher \\nlevels of task performance (β = .37) and in-\\nnovative work behavior (β = .45), as measured \\nby self-report questionnaires, and mediated \\nthe link between line manager behavior, hrm \\npractices, and individual performance. hence, \\nhypotheses 3 and 4 were fully supported. \\nthese results have several theoretical implica-\\ntions, which we consider in turn. \\n\\nfirst, we show that employees’ experi-\\nences of perceived line manager behavior are \\nan essential element in the hrm-performance \\nlinkage. viewed through the lens of social \\nexchange theory, our data suggest that line \\nmanagers have an important role to play, not \\njust in the way they implement and enact

of \\nthe value placed upon them. hence, employ-\\nees’ experiences of hrm occur along at least \\ntwo dimensions, first their experiences of \\nhrm policies and practices, and second the \\nway they are treated by their line manager. \\npositive experiences of hrm practices alone \\nappear insufficient to generate high lev-\\nels of engagement and performance; rather, \\nour data suggest that it is the combination \\nof positive perceived line manager behavior \\nand positive experiences of hrm practices \\ntogether that is associated with an engaged \\nand high-performing workforce. these find-\\nings support the argument that a systemic \\napproach is needed when examining the \\nhrm-performance linkage, one that focuses \\non the general working climate experienced \\nby employees, which will inevitably include \\ntheir perceptions of their line manager as \\nwell as hrm policy implementation (purcell \\n& hutchinson, 2007). \\n\\nour findings also lend support to the \\nsmall number of other studies that have dem-\\nonstrated a link between positive experiences \\nof hrm practices and individual-level perfor-\\nmance outcomes. data from our study show \\nthat where employees’ experiences of hrm \\npractices are positive, self-report individual \\nperformance in terms of task performance \\nand innovative work behavior is enhanced. \\nthis can be understood through the lens of \\nsocial exchange theory, which suggests that \\nwhere employees feel that their organiza-\\ntion is investing in them through the posi-\\ntive experiences they have of hrm policy and \\nline manager behavior, they are more willing \\nto reciprocate through high levels of engage-\\nment and performance. a focus on intended \\nhrm strategy alone will not capture the lived \\nexperiences of employees and will omit critical \\ndimensions of the exchange relationship. this \\nreflects the findings of other studies that have \\nsuggested that it is not the hrm strategies \\nintended by the organization that are most \\nsignificant in the hrm-performance chain, \\nbut rather how employees experience those \\nhrm practices (gratton & truss, 2003; kinnie \\net al., 2005; nishii et al., 2008). consequently, \\nthis lends further weight to the argument that \\n\\nstudies of the hrm-performance linkage need \\nto seek the views not just of hrm managers, \\nbut also of individual employees (den hartog \\net al., 2004).\\n\\nfinally, we bring together two hitherto \\ndisparate bodies of literature by demon-\\nstrating that employee engagement acts as \\na mediator linking perceived hrm practices \\nand perceived line manager behavior to self-\\nreport individual performance. no prior stud-\\nies have examined the link between hrm, \\nemployee engagement, and individual per-\\nformance. some earlier research has shown \\nthat attitudes are an important element in \\nthe hrm-performance chain, focusing on \\nother attitudinal constructs such as commit-\\nment, job satisfaction, and ocb (allen et al., \\n2003; batt, 2002; sun et al., 2007). equally, \\nseveral prior studies have argued that there is \\na link between perceived line manager behav-\\nior and engagement (may et al., 2004), and \\nbetween engagement and individual perfor-\\nmance (rich et al., 2010). by bringing these \\nlines of argument together, consistent with \\nour predictions, our data suggest that engage-\\nment acts as an important mediator between \\nhrm and individual performance. although \\nthis is a new finding, it is in line with our \\npredictions based on the engagement litera-\\nture (christian et al., 2011; halbesleben &\\nwheeler, 2008; rich et al., 2010), and on \\nthe literature linking perceived hrm with \\nattitudinal and behavioral outcomes (allen \\net al., 2003; snape & redman, 2010). within \\na social exchange relationship, employees’ \\npositive perceptions of organizational invest-\\nments in them, communicated through line \\nmanager behavior and perceived hrm prac-\\ntices, give rise to a willingness to engage cog-\\nnitively, affectively, and behaviorally, and to \\nconsequent high levels of task performance \\nand innovative work behavior. \\n\\nimplications for practitioners\\n\\nour data provide further support to the grow-\\ning interest in the changing relationship be-\\ntween line managers and hrm professionals in \\nthe management of employees. the current \\nstudy shows that line managers play an impor-\\ntant role in creating and maintaining a positive \\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 853\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\n  our study \\n\\ndemonstrates that it \\n\\nis through effective \\n\\npartnership that \\n\\nhrm practitioners \\n\\nand line managers \\n\\nare able to elicit \\n\\npositive responses \\n\\nfrom their workforce.\\n\\nenvironment in which employees are willing \\nto engage and perform. this emphasizes the \\nimportance of a symbiotic relationship be-\\ntween hrm professionals and line managers \\n(purcell & hutchinson, 2007). collaboration \\nbetween both parties will enable the effective \\nimplementation of hrm practices, which are \\npositively perceived by employees and encour-\\nage them to reciprocate by enacting desired be-\\nhaviors. our study demonstrates that it is \\nthrough effective partnership that hrm practi-\\ntioners and line managers are able to elicit posi-\\ntive responses from their workforce. \\n\\nour findings have specific implications \\nfor hrm professionals. arguably, the goal of \\nstrategic hrm is to evoke positive employee \\nattitudes and improve performance. the cru-\\ncial question for hrm practitioners is how to \\nachieve these objectives. a key challenge is \\nto ensure that hrm policies and practices are \\nenacted in a consistent way by different line \\nmanagers across the organization. one focus \\nfor hrm professionals should be the align-\\nment of line managers’ performance goals \\nand objectives with desired strategic hrm \\noutcomes, and the assessment of line manag-\\ners’ performance based on their approach to \\nmanaging people.\\n\\nmoreover, our data show that employee \\nperceptions of hrm practices play an impor-\\ntant role in determining individual perfor-\\nmance and, in conjunction with perceived \\nline manager behavior, are associated with \\nhigher levels of employee engagement. \\ncreating a highly engaged workforce has \\nbecome a significant focus for many organi-\\nzations recently (macleod & clarke, 2009; \\ntruss, soane, alfes, rees, & gatenby, 2010), \\nand our study indicates to hrm profession-\\nals that line managers have to be integrated \\nin any strategies designed to maintain or \\nincrease engagement levels.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nalthough our research provides interesting \\ninsights into the causal chain linking line \\nmanager behavior, hrm practices, employee \\nengagement, and individual performance, \\nthe findings should be assessed against the \\nbackground of the limitations inherent in our \\n\\nstudy. first, we collected data in each organi-\\nzation at one point in time, which limits the \\nconclusions that can be made regarding \\nthe causal order of our relationships. it might, \\nfor example, be possible that employee en-\\ngagement leads to positive perceptions of \\nhrm practices. second, we relied on individu-\\nals’ self-reports on all variables of our model, \\nwhich raises concerns about possible com-\\nmon method bias. however, our analysis indi-\\ncated that common method bias was not an \\nissue in either organization and the results ob-\\ntained were stable in two different organiza-\\ntions and generalizable across a number of \\ndemographic criteria. moreover, in terms of \\nthe current study, our focus was on employee \\nperceptions of hrm as the first \\nlink between hrm practices and \\noutcomes (wright & boswell, \\n2002), and so we would argue that \\nself-report measures might actually \\nbe the most valid measurement \\nmethod for most of our constructs, \\nas individuals are best placed to re-\\nport their own levels of engage-\\nment, their perceptions of hrm \\npractices, and line manager behav-\\nior. hence, the only constructs \\nthat could have been measured by \\nmultiple data sources are self-\\nreport performance and innova-\\ntive work behavior. although at \\nleast two data sources are required \\nto help rule out the validity threats \\nof self-report and single-method bias \\n(donaldson & grant-vallone, 2002), a recent \\nreview of performance appraisal research sug-\\ngests that performance ratings by line manag-\\ners might be equally biased as self-rated \\nperformance (levy & williams, 2004). \\nmoreover, authors have recently questioned the \\nassumption that common-method variance \\ncauses serious problems in organizational re-\\nsearch (spector, 2006). nevertheless, we encour-\\nage future researchers to collect data from mul-\\ntiple sources to investigate our findings further.\\n\\nimplications for research\\n\\nin our study we shed light on the roles line \\nmanagers and hrm professionals play in \\n\\n\\n\\n854 , november–december 2013\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nshaping employees’ attitudes and behaviors at \\nwork. we have demonstrated that it is impor-\\ntant to consider how line managers affect em-\\nployees’ perceptions of hrm practices and poli-\\ncies, which supports the notion of a symbiotic \\nrelationship between both parties for the effec-\\ntive management of people. we encourage fu-\\nture research to further explore the dynamics \\nbetween hrm professionals and line managers \\nin the enactment of hrm practices and their \\neffect on employee attitudes and behaviors. \\n\\nan interesting question arising out of our \\nresearch is whether different occupational \\ngroups within one organization share the same \\nperceptions of line management behavior, \\nhrm practices, engagement, and individual \\nperformance. although we found some vari-\\nability in path coefficients between individuals \\nwith and without management responsibili-\\nties, we did not find a significant difference \\nwith regard to the overall model. we encour-\\nage future research to assess whether there are \\ndifferences in individuals’ perceptions based \\non their occupational background. indeed, \\nkinnie et al. (2005) suggest that the relation-\\nships depicted in our model may well vary \\nbetween different groups of employees.\\n\\nfuture research might also analyze \\nwhether different leadership styles have a \\ndifferential impact on employees’ percep-\\ntion of, and attributions to, hrm systems. \\nfor example, would an engaging leader-\\nship style (chartered institute of personnel \\nand development [cipd], 2008) lead to a \\nmore positive evaluation of the hrm system \\ncompared to traditional transactional and \\ntransformational leadership styles? we also \\nencourage consideration of how employ-\\nees’ perceptions of the wider organizational \\nclimate, such as perceived organizational \\nsupport and organizational trust, might be \\nrelated to perceived hrm practices and line \\nmanagement behavior. \\n\\nour study has demonstrated that it is \\nimportant to consider employee perceptions \\nwhen evaluating the impact of hrm practices. \\nfuture research could assess to what extent line \\nmanagers’ perceptions of hrm practices influ-\\nence their employees’ perceptions of hrm \\npractices, using multilevel data from different \\ndata sources in the organization. it might be \\n\\nthat line managers who have positive experi-\\nences of hrm themselves shape their subordi-\\nnates’ perceptions and attitudes toward hrm.\\n\\nfinally, we encourage researchers to \\nevaluate changes in the effect of line man-\\nager behavior and hrm practices over time. \\nby adopting longitudinal research designs, \\nresearchers will be able to demonstrate \\ncausal effects in the hrm-performance chain \\nand assess the impact of any intervention \\ndesigned to enhance employee attitudes and \\nperformance.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nour study has contributed to debates around \\nthe hrm-individual performance link \\nthrough the development and testing of a \\nmediated model incorporating employee en-\\ngagement as the key attitudinal variable, and \\nanalyzing the role of line managers in this \\ncausal chain. through structural equation \\nmodeling on a sample of 1,796 respondents \\nfrom two organizations, we tested a number \\nof hypotheses to determine how these factors \\nare interrelated. we found that employees’ \\nperceptions of line manager behavior and \\nhrm practices are positively related to levels \\nof employee engagement, and that engage-\\nment, in turn, mediated the link with self-\\nreport individual performance. these find-\\nings are consistent with social exchange the-\\nory, which suggests that organizations able to \\ncultivate a climate of reciprocity will elicit \\npositive attitudinal and behavioral outcomes \\nfrom employees. we argue that hrm’s impact \\non performance outcomes is therefore indi-\\nrect rather than direct, and that the focus of \\nhrm efforts should be first on the effective \\nselection, deployment, and performance \\nmanagement of line managers, second on \\nsupporting line managers to ensure the fair \\nand consistent enactment of intended hrm \\npractices, and third on developing and imple-\\nmenting employee engagement strategies. \\nthese factors together will create a virtuous \\ncycle fostering high levels of performance.\\n\\nnote\\n\\n1. the full results are available from the fi rst author \\n\\nupon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n line managers, hrm practices, and their relationship with engagement and individual performance 855\\n\\n doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\n is an assistant professor in the department of human resource studies \\nat tilburg university. her research interests include employee engagement, strategic hu-\\n\\nman resource management, overqualifi cation, and the management of change. she has \\n\\nwritten on these topics in journals such as  journal;

along least dimensions first their experiences policies practices second they treated their line manager. positive experiences practices alone appear insufficient generate high levels engagement performance rather data suggest that combination positive perceived line manager behavior positive experiences practices together that associated with engaged high performing workforce.these findings support argument that systemic approach needed when examining performance linkage that focuses general working climate experienced employees which will inevitably include their perceptions their line manager well policy implementation purcell hutchinson . findings also lend support small number other studies that have demonstrated link between positive experiences practices individual level performance outcomes.data from study show that where employees experiences practices positive self report individual performance terms task performance innovative work behavior enhanced. this understood through lens social exchange theory which suggests that where employees feel that their organization investing them through positive experiences they have policy line manager behavior they more willing reciprocate through high levels engagement performance. focus intended strategy alone will capture lived experiences employees will omit critical dimensions exchange relationship.this reflects findings other studies that have suggested that strategies intended organization that most significant performance chain rather employees experience those practices gratton truss kinnie nishii .consequently this lends further weight argument that studies performance linkage need seek views just managers also individual employees hartog .finally bring together hitherto disparate bodies literature demonstrating that employee engagement acts mediator linking perceived practices perceived line manager behavior selfreport individual performance. prior studies have examined link between employee engagement individual performance.some earlier research shown that attitudes important element performance chain focusing other attitudinal constructs such commitment satisfaction allen batt .equally several prior studies have argued that there link between perceived line manager behavior engagement between engagement individual performance rich . bringing these lines argument together consistent with predictions data suggest that engagement acts important mediator between individual performance.although this finding line with predictions based engagement literature christian halbesleben wheeler rich literature linking perceived with attitudinal behavioral outcomes allen snape redman .within social exchange relationship employees positive perceptions organizational investments them communicated through line manager behavior perceived practices give rise willingness engage cognitively affectively behaviorally consequent high levels task performance innovative work behavior. implications practitioners data provide further support growing interest changing relationship between line managers professionals management employees. current study shows that line managers play important role creating maintaining positive line managers practices their relationship with engagement individual performance . study demonstrates that through effective partnership that practitioners line managers able elicit positive responses from their workforce.environment which employees willing engage perform.this emphasizes importance symbiotic relationship between professionals line managers purcell hutchinson .collaboration between both parties will enable effective implementation practices which positively perceived employees encourage them reciprocate enacting desired behaviors. study demonstrates that through effective partnership that practitioners line managers able elicit positive responses from their workforce. findings have specific implications professionals.arguably goal strategic evoke positive employee attitudes improve performance. crucial question practitioners achieve these objectives. challenge ensure that policies practices enacted consistent different line managers across organization. focus professionals should alignment line managers performance goals objectives with desired strategic outcomes assessment line managers performance based their approach managing people.moreover data show that employee perceptions practices play important role determining individual performance conjunction with perceived line manager behavior associated with higher levels employee engagement. creating highly engaged workforce become significant focus many organizations recently macleod clarke truss soane alfes rees gatenby study indicates professionals that line managers have integrated strategies designed maintain increase engagement levels.limitations although research provides interesting insights into causal chain linking line manager behavior practices employee engagement individual performance findings should assessed against background limitations inherent study.first collected data each organization point time which limits conclusions that made regarding causal order relationships. might example possible that employee engagement leads positive perceptions practices.second relied individuals self reports variables model which raises concerns about possible common method bias.however analysis indicated that common method bias issue either organization results obtained were stable different organizations generalizable across number demographic criteria.moreover terms current study focus employee perceptions first link between practices outcomes wright boswell would argue that self report measures might actually most valid measurement method most constructs individuals best placed report their levels engagement their perceptions practices line manager behavior.hence only constructs that could have been measured multiple data sources selfreport performance innovative work behavior.although least data sources required help rule validity threats self report single method bias donaldson grant vallone recent review performance appraisal research suggests that performance ratings line managers might equally biased self rated performance levy williams . moreover authors have recently questioned assumption that common method variance causes serious problems organizational research spector .nevertheless encourage future researchers collect data from multiple sources investigate findings further.implications research study shed light roles line managers professionals play november december . shaping employees attitudes behaviors work. have demonstrated that important consider line managers affect employees perceptions practices policies which supports notion symbiotic relationship between both parties effective management people. encourage future research further explore dynamics between professionals line managers enactment practices their effect employee attitudes behaviors. interesting question arising research whether different occupational groups within organization share same perceptions line management behavior practices engagement individual performance.although found some variability path coefficients between individuals with without management responsibilities find significant difference with regard overall model. encourage future research assess whether there differences individuals perceptions based their occupational background.indeed kinnie . suggest that relationships depicted model well vary between different groups employees.future research might also analyze whether different leadership styles have differential impact employees perception attributions systems. example would engaging leadership style chartered institute personnel development lead more positive evaluation system compared traditional transactional transformational leadership styles. also encourage consideration employees perceptions wider organizational climate such perceived organizational support organizational trust might related perceived practices line management behavior. study demonstrated that important consider employee perceptions when evaluating impact practices. future research could assess what extent line managers perceptions practices influence their employees perceptions practices using multilevel data from different data sources organization. might that line managers have positive experiences themselves shape their subordinates perceptions attitudes toward .finally encourage researchers evaluate changes effect line manager behavior practices over time. adopting longitudinal research designs researchers will able demonstrate causal effects performance chain assess impact intervention designed enhance employee attitudes performance.conclusion study contributed
