(na-\\ntional association of colleges and employ-\\ners [nace], 2006). even during economic \\ndownturns, employers use internships to \\nexpand their future talent pool (lhuby, \\n2008). in

seeks to bridge thesps. it \\naddresses the fundamental question, “how is \\nthe structure of mba intern roles related to \\nintern learning and job acceptance?” using a \\nlongitudinal sample of mba interns from \\n\\nthree business schools, this study \\ntests hypotheses regarding three \\nfactors relevant to mba intern \\nlearning: 1) the clarity of the task \\ngoals to be accomplished during \\nthe internship, 2) the intern’s au-\\ntonomy in pursuing thesals, \\nand 3) the intern’s prior work ex-\\nperience. we develop and test the \\nhypotheses that the intern’s at-\\ntention and effort can be more \\nfocused on learning when task \\ngoals are clear—contingent on the \\nintern’s prior level of experience \\nand autonomy in the job. we also \\ninvestigate the link that learning \\nhas with mba interns’ intentions \\nto accept full-time job offers from \\ntheir internship employer.\\n\\nmba internships share attri-\\nbutes with broader forms of \\ncontemporary employment. pro-\\nfessionals increasingly take on \\nshort-term jobs as consultants or \\nindependent contractors in \\nwhich they must learn and per-\\n\\nform concomitantly (see, , arthur & \\nrousseau, 1996; barley & kunda, 2004). \\nsuch jobs typically entail ever-greater per-\\nformance pressures requiring their occu-\\npants quickly to acquire additional skills \\nneeded to do the job (rousseau, 2006). as \\nsuch, with the mba internship as our con-\\ntext, this study also seeks to explicate how \\nfast learning can be facilitated in contempo-\\nrary, short-term, performance-pressured \\nwork. figure 1 displays the framework de-\\nveloped and tested here.\\n\\ngoal clarity, learning, and job \\nacceptance intentions\\n\\nrole theory is the dominant paradigm for \\nunderstanding how people learn new jobs \\nand responsibilities (bauer, bodner, erdogan, \\ntruxillo, & tucker, 2007; saks & ashforth, \\n1997), providing a useful starting point to \\nunderstand how on-the-job learning occurs. \\nroles are expectations associated with an or-\\nganizational position. they are “sent” by a \\nrole set (, supervisors, coworkers, and cli-\\nents) and “received” by the role occupant \\n(ilgen & hollenbeck, 1992)—in this study’s \\ncontext, an mba intern. unclear roles cause \\nstress (jackson & schuler, 1985; kahn, wolfe, \\nquinn, snoek, & rosenthal, 1964). stress, in \\nturn, reduces the would-be learner’s available \\nattention to process new information and \\nrespond to novel task demands (kanfer & \\nackerman, 1989).\\n\\nrole theory further distinguishes task \\ngoals from task activities (kahn , 1964, p. \\n94). task goals refer to the work products to \\nbe completed (locke & latham, 1990, 2002), \\nwhile activities are the specific task strategies \\nused to accomplish thesals. for example, \\ncompleting a marketing report by the end of \\na 10-week internship is a task goal. interview-\\ning clients, analyzing population data, and \\ncreating summary tables are the specific ac-\\ntivities associated with that goal. though task \\ngoals and activities are rarely studied as sepa-\\nrate role dimensions (king & king, 1990; \\nsawyer, 1992), the distinction is important \\nfor mba interns who have only a short \\namount of time to learn and show how they \\ncan perform. here we focus on task goal clar-\\nity as a specific factor in structuring a new \\nrole to facilitate learning. the mba intern-\\nship may cause variations in role structure to \\nbe more impactful than for other forms of \\nwork because the intern tends to be highly \\nmotivated to obtain specific outcomes (, \\nnew skills, a potential job offer; ashforth, \\n2001).\\n\\ntask goal clarity in this context is the ex-\\ntent to which the mba intern understands \\nwhat work products he or she is expected to \\nproduce and the standards by which those \\nproducts will be evaluated. when task goals \\n\\nmba internships \\n\\nshare attributes

to focus on relevant \\nactivities and develop the skills the work \\nproducts require. an mba intern, for exam-\\nple, may need to figure out how to build an \\nappropriate spreadsheet model when the task \\ngoal is to complete a marketing analysis. the \\npresent study focuses on task learning: that \\nis, positive change in task-related skills (an-\\nderson, 2000). task learning is a facet of the \\nbroader learning domain in which individu-\\nals build knowl regarding themselves, \\ntheir environment, and others through expe-\\nrience and reflection (bandura, 1986). task \\nskills may be enacted, as in the case of creat-\\ning a spreadsheet model for the first time, or \\nlatent, in the form of insights on how to ana-\\nlyze a particular market niche. when task \\ngoals are unclear, uncertainty and stress are \\nexpected to impair the interns’ ability to \\nlearn by making it difficult to identify, ac-\\nquire, and perform appropriate activities to \\naccomplish the task (jackson & schuler, 1985; \\nsaks & ashforth, 1997). task goal clarity pro-\\nvides scaffolding, meaning the task structures \\nand organizing frameworks that help learners \\nselect, develop, and execute activities that \\nconstitute learning (seidel, rimmele, & pren-\\nzel, 2005). goal clarity can provide learning \\nscaffolds through the work design itself, as in \\nthe case of well-specified work products that \\naid learning by doing (eraut, 2007), or via \\ninterpersonal support mentors provide that \\nhelps identify appropriate activities (lankau \\n& scandura, 2002). in general, novices learn \\nbetter when they arven task structures \\nthat guide problem-solving activities (reiser, \\n\\n2005). task goal clarity is the task structure \\non which the present study focuses.\\n\\njob acceptance intentions in this paper’s \\ncontext refer to the mba intern’s belief in his \\nor her likelihood of accepting a full-time job \\noffer with the internship employer. mba in-\\nterns who learn more from their internship \\nare expected to be highly motivated to accept \\na job offer from their employer in contrast to \\nthose who learn less. this is particularly likely \\nin the case of acquiring task knowl, \\nwhere expanding one’s skills on the job \\ncan signal a compelling future and generate \\ncommitment to the organization (hornung, \\nrousseau, & glaser, 2009; rousseau, hor-\\nnung, & kim, 2009). in contrast, other forms \\nof learning can either positively or negatively \\nimpact one’s motivation to accept a job offer, \\ndepending on the knowl acquired \\n(gundry & rousseau, 1994; holton, 1996). \\nlearning about the structure of an organiza-\\ntion, for example, may make it a less (or \\nmore) attractive place to work. job accep-\\ntance intentions are known to predict actual \\njob acceptance and indicate how attractive \\nan employer is to a job candidate (see, , \\ncable & judge, 1996). organizations that \\nprovide mba interns with more task learning \\nopportunities are likely to be attractive em-\\nployers for several reasons. first, developing \\nskills meets individual intrinsic needs for \\ncompetence and autonomy. employers pro-\\nviding this opportunity, therefore, are more \\ndesirable places to work (sheldon, turban, \\nbrown, barrick, & judge, 2003). second, \\nlearning opportunities during internships \\nsignal the potential for similar opportunities \\n\\nfigure 1. hypothesized relationships\\n\\n getting the most from mba internships 5\\n\\n\\n\\n6 human resource management, january/february 2010\\n\\nhuman resource management doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\nin future, full-time positions. interns are mo-\\ntivated to remain with an employer where \\nlearning opportunities are anticipated (ng, \\nbutts, vandenb dejoy, & wilson, 2006). \\nthird, learning enhances prospects for ad-\\nvancing in one’s career with a particular em-\\nployer (fugate, kinicki, & ashforth, 2004; \\n\\nhall, 2002; rollag, parise, & cross, \\n2005). thus, employers who offer \\ntask learning opportunities should \\nbe more attractive to mba in-\\nterns.\\n\\nto summarize, task goal clar-\\nity is expected to help mba in-\\nterns learn. it does so by focusing \\ntheir efforts and attention on task-\\nrelated activities, thus expanding \\ntheir skill repertoire. learning, in \\nturn, is expected to strhen \\ninterns’ job acceptance intentions \\n\\nby making the employer a more attractive \\nplace for them to launch their postgradua-\\ntion careers. thus, for mba interns we hy-\\npothesize:\\n\\nhypothesis 1: task goal clarity is positively re-\\nlated to learning.\\n\\nhypothesis 2: learning is positively related to job \\nacceptance intentions.\\n\\nautonomy and learning\\n\\nautonomy is the freedom or discretion mba \\ninterns have to carry out assigned task \\ngoals (hackman & oldham, 1980). it is an \\nimportant dimension of effective job design \\n(hackman & oldham, 1975, 1980) and psy-\\nchological empowerment (spreitzer, 1996). \\nautonomy can enable learning by strh-\\nening individual commitment to task goals \\n(locke & schwr, 1979), enhancing in-\\ntrinsic motivation and task persistence \\n(sheldon , 2003), and providing oppor-\\ntunities to take on new responsibilities \\n(parker, 1998). studies that combine specific \\nassigned goals (a form of task goal clarity) \\nwith worker participation (a form of auton-\\nomy) report a positive association with \\nworker productivity gains, which correlate \\nwith and possibly indicate learning (camp-\\n\\nbell & gingrich, 1986; miller & monge, \\n1986).\\n\\nthis body of previous research gives rise \\nto the hypothesis that high autonomy will \\nstrhen the positive effect of task goal \\nclarity on learning through the mechanisms \\nnoted: that is, goal commitment, goal inter-\\nnalization and persistence, and taking on \\nnew responsibilities (locke & schwr, \\n1979; parker, 1998; sheldon , 2003). \\nlow autonomy, in turn, should undermine \\nthese enabling mechanisms, thereby dimin-\\nishing the positive effect of task goal clarity \\non learning. unclear task goals combined \\nwith high autonomy lead to ambiguity in \\nboth task goals and the activities appropriate \\nto accomplishing goals (kahn , 1964; \\nking & king, 1990; rizzo, house, & lirtz-\\nman, 1970). low goal clarity means that an \\nimportant scaffold for learning is missing—\\nclear goals (seidel , 2005). low auton-\\nomy under these conditions reduces some \\nambiguity: it provides alternative support for \\nlearning as structured activities. although \\ninterns in these conditions may not precisely \\nunderstand their task goals, learning can still \\noccur as the interns perform prescribed ac-\\ntivities.\\n\\nwe note that prior research linking high \\nautonomy with learning has focused on how \\nexperienced workers learn on the job. as such, \\nthe brevity of the internship may be a \\nboundary condition, impeding the typical \\nbenefits of autonomy on learning. workers \\nfamiliar with their responsibilities tend to \\nhave high task goal clarity. in contrast, mba \\ninterns are likely to experience wide varia-\\ntions in task goal clarity. their roles entail \\nnew settings with unfamiliar responsibilities \\nto be fulfilled in a limited time. autonomy in \\nthe context of mba intern learning, there-\\nfore, may not offer the same advantages as it \\ndoes for regular full-time employees. for ex-\\nample, mba interns who have a lot of au-\\ntonomy may not learn well if they are unsure \\nof their task goals. we propose, therefore, an \\nalternative hypothesis regarding the interac-\\ntion effect of task goal clarity and autonomy \\non learning.\\n\\nbecause mba interns have only t to \\n12 weeks to fulfill their responsibilities, roles \\n\\nthe brevity of the \\n\\ninternship may be a \\n\\nboundary condition, \\n\\nimpeding the typical \\n\\nbenefits of autonomy \\n\\non

finding \\nways to get a job done. this autonomy can \\nlead interns, particularly those who lack ap-\\npropriate task strategies, to be ineffective at \\nsearching for such strategies (kanfer & acker-\\nman, 1989). high autonomy may cause in-\\nterns to develop an array of new task plans of \\nvarying quality and appropriateness (locke \\n& latham, 1990), which impairs efficiency \\nand learning as they perform tasks (drach-\\nzahavy & erez, 2002). lower autonomy, on \\nthe other hand, could provide interns with \\nmore complete scaffolding (seidel , \\n2005). it may focus interns’ attention and \\neffort on prescribed activities and proce-\\ndures, thereby allowing them to learn while \\neffectively completing work products.\\n\\nresearch on short-term training supports \\nthis alternative view with its finding that \\ndirective supervisor feedback leads to greater \\nperformancins (i.e., correlates with and \\npotentially indicates learning) than does par-\\nticipative feedback (hillery & wexley, 1974). \\nthough not identical to variations in auton-\\nomy, directive versus participative supervisor \\nfeedback can generate differences in the au-\\ntonomy learners experience in their roles. \\ndirective supervisor feedback can translate \\ninto control over how work gets done for \\nlearners who are responsive to feedback, \\nstructuring on-the-job behavior more in line \\nwith supervisor direction. in contrast, par-\\nticipative feedback provides more opportuni-\\nties for subordinates to influence the way \\ntheir work is done, supporting greater job \\nautonomy. indeed, a worker can experience \\nlimited autonomy and little learning when a \\nsupervisor directs him or her to ge in \\nseemingly meaningless activities. in the pres-\\nent context of mba internships, however, it \\nis more likely that the structuring that limits \\nan intern’s autonomy is intended to be func-\\ntional given the value employers seek to gain \\nfrom internships (baron & kreps, 1999; \\nnace, 2006, p. 22). by implication, lower \\nautonomy is expected to facilitate learning \\nin short-term situations by directing a worker \\ntoward using more effective task strategies.\\n\\nin summary, prior research has suggested \\nhigher autonomy should strhen the re-\\n\\nlationship between goal clarity and learning. \\nin a short-term job, however, it is possible \\nthat higher autonomy may divert attention \\nand effort away from learning and toward \\nfiguring out how to get the job \\ndone. we thus pose two compet-\\ning hypotheses regarding how \\ngoal clarity and autonomy in an \\nmba intern’s role structure are \\nrelated to learning.\\n\\nhypothesis 3a: autonomy moder-\\nates the relationship of task goal \\nclarity and learning. consistently \\nwith research on regular workers, \\nthe relationship is expected to be \\nstronger when autonomy is high \\nand weaker when it is low.\\n\\nhypothesis 3b: autonomy moderates \\nthe relationship of task goal clarity \\nand learning. consistently with re-\\nsearch on short-term training, the re-\\nlationship is expected to be stronger \\nwhen autonomy is low and weaker \\nwhen it is high.\\n\\nexperience and learning\\n\\nexperience is defined here as the \\nlevel of full-time work experience \\nan individual has prior to the \\nmba internship. unlike typically \\ninexperienced undaduate in-\\nterns, mba interns differ in their \\nlevels of experience (dreher & \\nryan, 2004). among recent full-\\ntime mba program applicants, 24% had less \\nthan three years of experience; 62% had \\nthree to 11 years; and 14% had more than 11 \\nyears (gmac, 2006). experienced mba in-\\nterns have been exposed to more work set-\\ntings, tasks, projects, and work roles than \\nhave inexperienced ones (tesluk & jacobs, \\n1998). consequently, they should possess a \\nlarger repertoire of skills and task activities \\nthan their less experienced counterparts. \\nthese differences should influence how mba \\ninterns respond to variations in autonomy. \\nfaced with more discretionary task activities, \\nexperienced mba interns should have a \\n\\nbecause mba interns \\n\\nhave

(kanfer & ackerman, \\n1989). attention and effort are diverted from \\nlearning and toward searching for ways to \\ncomplete tasks for which individuals lack the \\nskills or experience necessary to

should make it difficult to \\nrespond effectively to task goals, \\nbecause less experienced workers \\nlack the necessary scaffolding to \\nlearn and perform well in novel \\nenvironments (seidel ,

10.1002/hrm\\n\\nthe mba internship\\n\\nlearning during the internship appears to be \\na critical factor in an mba student’s inten-\\ntions to accept a regular job offer from a \\nsummer employer. yet, the conditions that \\npromote learning during an internship can \\ndiffer from those that create a good learning \\nenvironment for regular full-time employ-\\nees. learning during full-time employment \\noccurs over a period of months, if not years, \\nallowing employees to familiarize themselves \\nwith the employer’s goals and expectations. \\nin contrast, mba interns must learn quickly, \\nwith less time to develop the familiarity and \\nunderstanding that provide the scaffolding \\nfor acquiring new skills and activities. task \\ngoal clarity is a potentially important predic-\\ntor of mba intern learning. our results sug-\\ngest that goal clarity helps learners direct \\ntheir efforts effectively. given the varied cir-\\ncumstances in which an employer can create \\nan internship, agreeing on task goals is likely \\nto vary among managers, hr representatives, \\ncolles, and others whom interns en-\\ncounter on the job. given the potentially \\ninconsistent messages mba interns are likely \\nto encounter from these messrs, it may \\nbehoove an intern’s immediate supervisor to \\nbe especially diligent in specifying task goals \\nand ensuring a shared understanding of \\nthosals. setting clear task goals, our re-\\nsults suggest, is a critical feature for an effec-\\ntively structured internship.\\n\\nemployer practices are also important to \\nmba intern learning. interviews with interns \\nand employers conducted in the aftermath of \\nour study uncovered one employer’s exem-\\nplary practice—structuring its mba intern-\\nships to promote learning. this employer’s \\ninterns participated in a process of defining \\nthe internship’s goals. interns discussed and \\nrefined thesals with their primary super-\\nvisor. throughout the internship, goals were \\nrevisited in meetings with the supervisor and \\nrelevant coworkers. when the internship \\nconcluded, goal accomplishment was used as \\na major component of the intern’s perfor-\\nmance review. mba interns who worked for \\nthis employer reported that this process was \\nboth challng and useful for their learn-\\ning. even in firms with less systematic pro-\\ncesses, task goal clarity can be achieved via \\nefforts by the intern’s immediate manager to \\nestablish clear deliverables. this includes \\nwork products and evaluation standards, for \\nexample, a report with specific objectives \\naimed at a particular audience. the role struc-\\nturing process may also be enabled by identi-\\nfying requisite skills and activities for the \\nmba to master, such as interviewing internal \\nclients or diagnosing a performance prob-\\nlem.\\n\\nidentifying the appropriate level of au-\\ntonomy or discretion is the second feature our \\nstudy suggests is important for structuring an \\ninternship for learning. given the short time \\nframe mbas have to learn on the job, interns \\n\\nfigure 2. goal clarity x autonomy two-way interaction (hypothesis 3)\\n\\n\\n\\n16 human resource management, january/february 2010\\n\\nhuman resource management doi: 10.1002/hrm\\n\\ndiffer from the regular workers studied previ-\\nously in their capacity to benefit from auton-\\nomy. this finding is consistent with prior \\nresearch on short-term training. when lim-\\nited time exists to learn new skills and activi-\\nties, directive supervisor feedback can result \\nin greater performancins than participa-\\ntive feedback (hillery & wexley, 1974). mba \\ninterns typically have t to 12 weeks to \\nlearn new activities and fulfill their responsi-\\nbilities. too much autonomy can divert atten-\\ntion from learning. instead, the intern is \\nlikely to direct considerable effort searching \\nfor ways to get the job done. rushing to com-\\nplete a task at hand can undermine learning \\nby downplaying the value of dead ends and \\nalternative strategies. when lower autonomy \\nreflects the developmental direction that su-\\npervisors and coworkers provide, interns’ \\nlearning is likely to be better supported (seidel \\n, 2005).\\n\\nif a lack of appropriate structure makes \\nlearning in short-term roles more difficult, \\nthe effects of too much autonomy are even \\nmore pronounced when workers are less ex-\\nperienced. less experienced people have a \\nlimited repertoire of skills, activities, and re-\\nlated capacities for problem solving and task \\nplanning (ashforth, 2001; locke & latham, \\n1990). holding high goal clarity constant, less \\nexperienced interns reported more learning \\nwhen autonomy was low than did their more \\nexperienced counterparts. for more experi-\\nenced interns, goal clarity had a positive rela-\\n\\ntionship with learning, while autonomy had \\nnone. interns provided with clear task goals \\nappeared to need a base level of prior experi-\\nence to reap autonomy’s learning benefits.\\n\\nas in the case of the exemplary employer \\ndescribed earlier, setting internship goals \\nwith one’s supervisor to ensure appropriate-\\nness and understanding combines the best of \\nautonomy with goal clarity. participating in \\nsetting one’s own goals may provide suffi-\\ncient autonomy in work settings where learn-\\ning needs to occur quickly. goals are not \\nonly better understood in such cases, but \\nlikely to be effective in identifying appropri-\\nate task activities and acquiring new skills.\\n\\nthe antithesis of the enabling role struc-\\nture described previously is a supervisor \\nwho dictates what the intern is supposed to \\ndo day to day (low autonomy) without ex-\\nplaining why (low goal clarity). the least \\nlearning occurred where both goal clarity \\nand autonomy were low—an effect pro-\\nnounced for those with little prior experi-\\nence. a combination of rigid activities and \\nnot understanding their purpose can stifle \\nlearning.\\n\\nthe management practices that best pro-\\nmote learning may differ from those suited \\nto use internships as screening devices for \\nemployee selection. an employer who pri-\\nmarily values the existing skills an intern \\npossesses is likely to send different signals \\nthan an employer seeking an intern with \\nthe capacity to learn and perform. where \\n\\nfigure 3. goal clarity x autonomy x prior experience three-way interaction (hypothesis

internship \\npractices signal an attractive, compelling, \\nand skill-enhancing future with the organi-\\nzation (hornung , 2009; ng , 2006; \\nrousseau , 2009). employers whose sup-\\nportive, highly structured roles promote in-\\ntern learning are likely to allocate consider-\\nable resources to feedback, guidance, and \\nmentoring. employers using the internship \\nas a screening device are more likely to create \\nassignments that chall the intern’s skills, \\nrisking poor performance to evaluate those \\nskills. the former arrangement may reduce \\nan employer’s ability to use the intern’s per-\\nformance as a screening device, while the \\nlatter can make internship learning more dif-\\nficult.\\n\\nwe suggest that if the internship is used \\nto identify mbas who already possess sought-\\nafter skills, using intern performance as a \\nselection criterion may undercut the em-\\nployer’s ability to attract people who may \\nbe highly motivated to learn. employers \\nseeking to hire highly motivated and ambi-\\ntious mbas may be well advised to use \\nstandardized tests and structured interviews \\nto determine the skills that recruits possess. \\ndoing so better positions employers to use \\ninternships for learning opportunities that \\nsignal to interns an attractive future with \\nthe firm. this should improve the firm’s \\nability to recruit intern candidates.\\n\\nmanaging short-term workers\\n\\nour findings have implications beyond mba \\ninterns to newcomers in contemporary, short-\\nterm professional work arrangements. short-\\nterm workers doing consulting or project \\n\\nwork may learn better and faster when their \\nemployers provide degrees of autonomy com-\\nmensurate with their prior experience. expe-\\nrienced consultants and other contingent \\nworkers may learn the essentials of their \\nshort-term role through a combi-\\nnation of clear goals and high \\nautonomy. in contrast, where \\nshort-term workers are less experi-\\nenced, as is often the case for tem-\\nporary or seasonal employees, a \\ndifferent work structure is required. \\nwell-specified activities and clear \\ntask goals can help inexperienced \\nshort-term workers learn. conse-\\nquently, this structure is also likely \\nto facilitate their overall perfor-\\nmance. in contrast to experienced \\nworkers who benefit from greater \\nautonomy, inexperienced workers \\nrequire more employer resources \\nto structure their tasks and the \\nwork situation appropriately. as \\nsuch, more management time and \\nattention are needed to provide \\ndirective feedback and learning \\nopportunities for inexperienced \\nshort-term workers. alternatively, \\nmore effort may be required at \\nfirst to design work environments \\nin which short-term workers can quickly \\nlearn to perform effectively. such is the case \\nin firms that depend on short-term employ-\\nees’ performing effectively. mcdonald’s cor-\\nporation, for example, has more than 300% \\nemployee turnover in its restaurants. highly \\nstructured roles and work environments (, \\nwell-designed visuals guiding workers in \\nproper procedures for making and serving

with autonomy \\ncommensurate with the individu-\\nal’s experience.\\n\\nbecause contemporary work-\\ners can expect variations in goal \\nclarity as they enter new and \\nshort-term roles,

of the strategies that work-\\ners can use to prepare for new \\nshort-term roles. from the outset \\nof a short-term job, seeking goal \\nclarity by gathering information \\nregarding expectations from im-\\nportant stakeholders can be \\ncritical to both performing and \\nlearning effectively.\\n\\nlimitations, future \\nresearch, and contributions\\n\\nthis study has several limitations. \\nforemost is the fact that causality \\ncannot be determined, although \\ntwo design features increase con-\\nfidence in the causal direction \\nour hypotheses imply. autonomy \\nwas assessed at time 1, prior to \\nthe outcomes of learning and job \\nacceptance, which were measured \\nat time 2. job acceptance was \\nmeasured at both times 0 and 2, \\npermitting our analyses to inves-\\ntigate effects on changes in job \\nacceptance probability. some al-\\nternative explanations can also \\nbe considered and rejected. al-\\nthough clear task goals appear to \\nhelp mba interns develop skills \\non the job, an alternative expla-\\n\\nnation is that interns attracted to their em-\\nployer report more learning, consistently \\nwith both cognitive dissonance (festinger, \\n1957) and the observed higher learning \\nmeans associated with preinternship (time \\n0) above median job acceptance intentions. \\nour learning outcome analyses, however, \\ncontrolled for initial job acceptance proba-\\nbilities, ruling out response bias as an expla-\\nnation. indeed, participant interviews prior \\nto their internships indicated most were in-\\nterested in future employment with their \\nsummer employer. thus, an alternative \\ncausal order for thal clarity–learning re-\\nlationship is unlikely.\\n\\nrepresentativeness is also a concern. as \\nnoted in the sample description earlier, re-\\nspondents’ demographics are reasonably com-\\nparable to their school’s mba population, \\nmost of whom undertook an internship. also, \\nas noted, participating schools were drawn \\nfrom the first through third tiers of popular \\nmba programs. as such, we believe that our \\nsample is representative of the broader popu-\\nlation of mba interns. further, the short-term \\nnature of mba internships may be representa-\\ntive of a broader array of short-term profes-\\nsional work arrangements (, short-term \\nproject assignments, job rotations, and highly \\nskilled contingent workers).\\n\\nmost of our measures are self-report, \\nraising concerns regarding common method \\nbias. the interaction effects that compose \\nsome of our major findings, however, are \\nless subject to such bias than are main or \\ndirect effects. furthermore, our prior experi-\\nence variable was obtained from student \\nresumes and not surveys. prior experience \\nconstitutes an indirect measure of task skill \\nrepertoire, though it is an indicator easily \\navailable to a prospective intern’s em-\\nployer.\\n\\nperceptual bias is another factor, particu-\\nlarly with respect to the learning measure, \\nwhere an indicator of objective skill change \\nwould be preferred. nonetheless, explicit \\nforms of self-reported learning where particu-\\nlar skills are specified have been shown to \\ncorrespond to objective skill changes (kirsner \\n& speelman, 1998). these limitations can be \\naddressed by measuring skill level changes \\n\\nhighly structured \\n\\nroles and work \\n\\nenvironments (, \\n\\nwell-designed \\n\\nvisuals guiding \\n\\nworkers in proper \\n\\nprocedures \\n\\nfor making and \\n\\nserving food) \\n\\nhelp workers learn \\n\\ntheir jobs quickly. \\n\\nin contrast, when \\n\\nshort-term workers \\n\\nare professionals \\n\\nresponsible \\n\\nfor more complex \\n\\nknowl work, \\n\\nfast learning is \\n\\nmore difficult to \\n\\nenable by workplace \\n\\ndesign. instead \\n\\nit may be better \\n\\nachieved by high \\n\\nlevels of goal \\n\\nclarity coupled \\n\\nwith autonomy

with other \\nindicators of learning.\\n\\nlast, some potentially relevant factors \\nwere not assessed. we used implicit task \\nplans, strategies, and activities to explain ob-\\nserved effects, yet these were not measured. \\nbecause our results are consistent with the \\ntask plan and strategy constructs (locke & \\nlatham, 1990) and with the logic of scaffold-\\ning (siedel , 2005), future studies should \\nmeasure these constructs directly to test \\nwhether our explanations are confirmed. fur-\\nther, this study focused on task goal clarity, \\nwhile task goal difficulty may also be a factor \\nin both intern learning and performance. \\nfurther investigating the relationship be-\\ntween goal difficulty and relevant outcomes \\nfor internships and other short-term work \\nwould be informative.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nthis study makes three contributions. first, \\nit highlights the importance of task goal \\nclarity and autonomy in structuring mba \\ninternships for both learning and job accep-\\ntance. second, it demonstrates the potentially \\nimportant relationships task goal clarity has \\nwith learning in short-term roles (bauer \\n, 2007; bauer, morrison, & callister, \\n1998; saks & ashforth, 1997). this, itself, is \\nan underinvestigated outcome. third, it sug-\\ngests that inexperience can limit the benefits \\nautonomy provides to learning. in doing \\nso, the study calls attention to the trade-\\noffs among goal clarity, autonomy, and \\nskill learning in the context of mba intern-\\nships.\\n\\nmba interns are likely to benefit from a \\nwell-structured internship where their super-\\nvisor and related others set clear task goals \\nand provididance regarding the skills and \\nactivities needed to complete work products. \\nstructuring an mba intern’s role should take \\ninto account the individual’s prior experience \\nin determining how much autonomy or on-\\ngoing review and feedback are required. the \\n\\ntrend among contemporary employers such \\nas genentech and time warner (\\n ) to incorporate mentoring into \\nthe mba internship is consistent with our \\nrecommendation that a high-quality rela-\\ntionship providing mutual goal setting and \\nadjustments to task structuring may be opti-\\nmal for both intern and employer.\\n\\nour findings have implications beyond \\nmba interns to other newcomers in short-\\nterm professional work arrangements. short-\\nterm workers can learn better and faster when \\ntheir employers provide degrees of autonomy \\ncommensurate with their prior experience \\n(, more autonomy for more experienced \\ninterns). given the least experienced new-\\ncomers in this study learned less under higher \\nautonomy, these findings are particularly rel-\\nevant for “millennials” (i.e., those born in \\nthe 1980s). this includes current undadu-\\nates and those now entering full-time mba \\nprograms (gloeker, 2008), who have little \\nprior experience. there may well be a sweet \\nspot in structuring mba internships and \\nother short-term professional jobs character-\\nized by comparable demands—where clear \\ntask goals can be achieved by supporting \\nlearning in a fashion commensurate with the \\nworker’s (in)experience.\\n'"

      " getting the most from mba internships promoting intern learning and job acceptance human resource management human resource management january february vol.  no.  pp.  wiley periodicals inc.  published online in wiley interscience. we discuss how role structures and learning can inform effective training and recruiting of interns and management of short-term workers in general.  wiley periodicals inc. keywords goal clarity autonomy learning mba internships job acceptance intentions nternships are temporary work arrangements that employers use to train and select future employees. about of american college students participate in internships an arrangement employers find to be useful recruiting tool. even during economic downturns employers use internships to expand their future talent pool. in particular mba internships are valuable cost-effective source of management talent in organizations. they function as -week interview in which employers and candidates evaluate one another.  in the united states more than full-time mba students participate in internships annually and use in international mba programs is growing. despite their prevalence surprisingly little research exists on mba internships. instead the sparse internship literature focuses on undaduates. in contrast to mba interns undergraduate interns typically have little prior work experience and lower responsibilities.  the existing literature has also been limited correspondence to gerard beenen mihaylo college of business economics california state university. state college blvd.  fullerton ca phone --.  human resource management january february human resource management doi. hrm to investigating the internship impact on postgraduation job prospects and career plans. research has not investigated how the structure of the internship role may be related to the important outcomes of learning and job acceptance. our study seeks to bridge thesps. it addresses the fundamental question how is the structure of mba intern roles related to intern learning and job acceptance.  using longitudinal sample of mba interns from three business schools this study tests hypotheses regarding three factors relevant to mba intern learning the clarity of the task goals to be accomplished during the internship the intern autonomy in pursuing thesals and the intern prior work experience. we develop and test the hypotheses that the intern attention and effort can be more focused on learning when task goals are clear contingent on the intern prior level of experience and autonomy in the job. we also investigate the link that learning has with mba interns intentions to accept full-time job offers from their internship employer. mba internships share attributes with broader forms of contemporary employment. professionals increasingly take on short-term jobs as consultants or independent contractors in which they must learn and per form concomitantly.  such jobs typically entail ever-greater performance pressures requiring their occupants quickly to acquire additional skills needed to do the job. as such with the mba internship as our context this study also seeks to explicate how fast learning can be facilitated in contemporary short-term performance-pressured work. figure displays the framework developed and tested here. goal clarity learning and job acceptance intentions role theory is the dominant paradigm for understanding how people learn new jobs and responsibilities providing useful starting point to understand how on-the-job learning occurs.  roles are expectations associated with an organizational position. they are sent by role set and received by the role occupant in this study context an mba intern. unclear roles cause stress. stress in turn reduces the would-be learner available attention to process new information and respond to novel task demands. role theory further distinguishes task goals from task activities. task goals refer to the work products to be completed while activities are the specific task strategies used to accomplish thesals. for example completing marketing report by the end of -week internship is task goal. interviewing clients analyzing population data and creating summary tables are the specific activities associated with that goal. though task goals and activities are rarely studied as separate role dimensions the distinction is important for mba interns who have only short amount of time to learn and show how they can perform. here we focus on task goal clarity as specific factor in structuring new role to facilitate learning. the mba internship may cause variations in role structure to be more impactful than for other forms of work because the intern tends to be highly motivated to obtain specific outcomes. task goal clarity in this context is the extent to which the mba intern understands what work products he or she is expected to produce and the standards by which those products will be evaluated. when task goals mba internships share attributes with broader forms of contemporary employment.  professionals increasingly take on short-term jobs as consultants or independent contractors in which they must learn and perform concomitantly. human resource management doi. hrm are well understood the intern attention and effort are better able to focus on relevant activities and develop the skills the work products require. an mba intern for example may need to figure out how to build an appropriate spreadsheet model when the task goal is to complete marketing analysis. the present study focuses on task learning that is positive change in task-related skills. task learning is facet of the broader learning domain in which individuals build knowl regarding themselves their environment and others through experience and reflection. task skills may be enacted as in the case of creating spreadsheet model for the first time or latent in the form of insights on how to analyze particular market niche. when task goals are unclear uncertainty and stress are expected to impair the interns ability to learn by making it difficult to identify acquire and perform appropriate activities to accomplish the task. task goal clarity provides scaffolding meaning the task structures and organizing frameworks that help learners select develop and execute activities that constitute learning. goal clarity can provide learning scaffolds through the work design itself as in the case of well-specified work products that aid learning by doing or via interpersonal support mentors provide that helps identify appropriate activities. in general novices learn better when they arven task structures that guide problem-solving activities. task goal clarity is the task structure on which the present study focuses. job acceptance intentions in this paper context refer to the mba intern belief in his or her likelihood of accepting full-time job offer with the internship employer. mba interns who learn more from their internship are expected to be highly motivated to accept job offer from their employer in contrast to those who learn less. this is particularly likely in the case of acquiring task knowl where expanding one skills on the job can signal compelling future and generate commitment to the organization. in contrast other forms of learning can either positively or negatively impact one motivation to accept job offer depending on the knowl acquired.  learning about the structure of an organization for example may make it less attractive place to work. job acceptance intentions are known to predict actual job acceptance and indicate how attractive an employer is to job candidate. organizations that provide mba interns with more task learning opportunities are likely to be attractive employers for several reasons. first developing skills meets individual intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy. employers providing this opportunity therefore are more desirable places to work. second learning opportunities during internships signal the potential for similar opportunities figure. hypothesized relationships getting the most from mba internships human resource management january february human resource management doi. hrm in future full-time positions. interns are motivated to remain with an employer where learning opportunities are anticipated.  third learning enhances prospects for advancing in one career with particular employer. thus employers who offer task learning opportunities should be more attractive to mba interns. to summarize task goal clarity is expected to help mba interns learn. it does so by focusing their efforts and attention on taskrelated activities thus expanding their skill repertoire. learning in turn is expected to strhen interns job acceptance intentions by making the employer more attractive place for them to launch their postgraduation careers. thus for mba interns we hypothesize hypothesis task goal clarity is positively related to learning. hypothesis learning is positively related to job acceptance intentions. autonomy and learning autonomy is the freedom or discretion mba interns have to carry out assigned task goals. it is an important dimension of effective job design and psychological empowerment.  autonomy can enable learning by strhening individual commitment to task goals enhancing intrinsic motivation and task persistence and providing opportunities to take on new responsibilities. studies that combine specific assigned goals with worker participation report positive association with worker productivity gains which correlate with and possibly indicate learning. this body of previous research gives rise to the hypothesis that high autonomy will strhen the positive effect of task goal clarity on learning through the mechanisms noted that is goal commitment goal internalization and persistence and taking on new responsibilities.  low autonomy in turn should undermine these enabling mechanisms thereby diminishing the positive effect of task goal clarity on learning. unclear task goals combined with high autonomy lead to ambiguity in both task goals and the activities appropriate to accomplishing goals. low goal clarity means that an important scaffold for learning is missing clear goals. low autonomy under these conditions reduces some ambiguity it provides alternative support for learning as structured activities. although interns in these conditions may not precisely understand their task goals learning can still occur as the interns perform prescribed activities. we note that prior research linking high autonomy with learning has focused on how experienced workers learn on the job. as such the brevity of the internship may be boundary condition impeding the typical benefits of autonomy on learning. workers familiar with their responsibilities tend to have high task goal clarity. in contrast mba interns are likely to experience wide variations in task goal clarity. their roles entail new settings with unfamiliar responsibilities to be fulfilled in limited time. autonomy in the context of mba intern learning therefore may not offer the same advantages as it does for regular full-time employees. for example mba interns who have lot of autonomy may not learn well if they are unsure of their task goals. we propose therefore an alternative hypothesis regarding the interaction effect of task goal clarity and autonomy on learning. because mba interns have only to weeks to fulfill their responsibilities roles the brevity of the internship may be boundary condition impeding the typical benefits of autonomy on learning.  getting the most from mba internships human resource management doi. hrm with lot of autonomy can divert their attention from learning and toward finding ways to get job done. this autonomy can lead interns particularly those who lack appropriate task strategies to be ineffective at searching for such strategies. high autonomy may cause interns to develop an array of new task plans of varying quality and appropriateness which impairs efficiency and learning as they perform tasks. lower autonomy on the other hand could provide interns with more complete scaffolding. it may focus interns attention and effort on prescribed activities and procedures thereby allowing them to learn while effectively completing work products. research on short-term training supports this alternative view with its finding that directive supervisor feedback leads to greater performancins than does participative feedback.  though not identical to variations in autonomy directive versus participative supervisor feedback can generate differences in the autonomy learners experience in their roles.  directive supervisor feedback can translate into control over how work gets done for learners who are responsive to feedback structuring on-the-job behavior more in line with supervisor direction. in contrast participative feedback provides more opportunities for subordinates to influence the way their work is done supporting greater job autonomy. indeed worker can experience limited autonomy and little learning when supervisor directs him or her to ge in seemingly meaningless activities. in the present context of mba internships however it is more likely that the structuring that limits an intern autonomy is intended to be functional given the value employers seek to gain from internships. by implication lower autonomy is expected to facilitate learning in short-term situations by directing worker toward using more effective task strategies. in summary prior research has suggested higher autonomy should strhen the re lationship between goal clarity and learning.  in short-term job however it is possible that higher autonomy may divert attention and effort away from learning and toward figuring out how to get the job done. we thus pose two competing hypotheses regarding how goal clarity and autonomy in an mba intern role structure are related to learning. hypothesis autonomy moderates the relationship of task goal clarity and learning. consistently with research on regular workers the relationship is expected to be stronger when autonomy is high and weaker when it is low. hypothesis autonomy moderates the relationship of task goal clarity and learning. consistently with research on short-term training the relationship is expected to be stronger when autonomy is low and weaker when it is high. experience and learning experience is defined here as the level of full-time work experience an individual has prior to the mba internship. unlike typically inexperienced undaduate interns mba interns differ in their levels of experience. among recent fulltime mba program applicants had less than three years of experience had three to years and had more than years. experienced mba interns have been exposed to more work settings tasks projects and work roles than have inexperienced ones. consequently they should possess larger repertoire of skills and task activities than their less experienced counterparts.  these differences should influence how mba interns respond to variations in autonomy.  faced with more discretionary task activities experienced mba interns should have because mba interns have only to weeks to fulfill their responsibilities roles with lot of autonomy can divert their attention from learning and toward finding ways to get job done.  this autonomy can lead interns particularly those who lack appropriate task strategies to be ineffective at searching for such strategies.  human resource management january february human resource management doi. hrm greater number of interpretive schemas. these are mental representations of tasks and related activities that help workers make sense of their responsibilities. having an array of interpretive schemas helps people identify more effective ways to learn new work roles and accomplish task goals. task goals can impair learning when people lack appropriate task strategies because of inexperience. attention and effort are diverted from learning and toward searching for ways to complete tasks for which individuals lack the skills or experience necessary to perform well. less experienced mba interns tend to have smaller repertoire of skills and activities than do more experienced ones. their limited repertoires should make it difficult to respond effectively to task goals because less experienced workers lack the necessary scaffolding to learn and perform well in novel environments.  high autonomy is thus expected to exacerbate the difficulties that less experienced workers face. on the other hand experienced mba interns with larger skill set and activity repertoire are more likely to develop appropriate task strategies for accomplish ing goals. consequently they are disposed to experience the learning benefits of high autonomy because of their capacity to allocate attention and effort to learning better.  consistently with the logic of scaffolding experienced mba interns require less structure to learn and perform their roles because they are enabled by the larger repertoire of skills and activities their prior experience provides. in summary less experienced mba interns should learn more than their more experienced counterparts under conditions of low autonomy. in contrast those with more prior experience should learn more than their less experienced counterparts under conditions of high autonomy. this implies three-way interaction among task goal clarity autonomy and experience. hypothesis the relationship between task goal clarity and learning will be stronger for less experienced interns with low autonomy and stronger for more experienced interns with high autonomy. findings in the present study have important implications for management practices associated with mba internships. managers should consider the importance of learning to successful internship. to enable learning the intern task goal should be well specified and the potential impact of intern autonomy and prior experience on learning should be wed. our results also inform managing short-term workers in general particularly where specific skills and knowl are important to effective performance. a l

internships human resource management doi. hrm the mba internship learning during the internship appears to be critical factor in an mba student intentions to accept regular job offer from summer employer. yet the conditions that promote learning during an internship can differ from those that create good learning environment for regular full-time employees. learning during full-time employment occurs over period of months if not years allowing employees to familiarize themselves with the employer goals and expectations.  in contrast mba interns must learn quickly with less time to develop the familiarity and understanding that provide the scaffolding for acquiring new skills and activities. task goal clarity is potentially important predictor of mba intern learning. our results suggest that goal clarity helps learners direct their efforts effectively. given the varied circumstances in which an employer can create an internship agreeing on task goals is likely to vary among managers hr representatives colles and others whom interns encounter on the job. given the potentially inconsistent messages mba interns are likely to encounter from these messrs it may behoove an intern immediate supervisor to be especially diligent in specifying task goals and ensuring shared understanding of thosals. setting clear task goals our results suggest is critical feature for an effectively structured internship. employer practices are also important to mba intern learning. interviews with interns and employers conducted in the aftermath of our study uncovered one employer exemplary practice structuring its mba internships to promote learning. this employer interns participated in process of defining the internship goals. interns discussed and refined thesals with their primary supervisor. throughout the internship goals were revisited in meetings with the supervisor and relevant coworkers. when the internship concluded goal accomplishment was used as major component of the intern performance review. mba interns who worked for this employer reported that this process was both challng and useful for their learning. even in firms with less systematic processes task goal clarity can be achieved via efforts by the intern immediate manager to establish clear deliverables. this includes work products and evaluation standards for example report with specific objectives aimed at particular audience. the role structuring process may also be enabled by identifying requisite skills and activities for the mba to master such as interviewing internal clients or diagnosing performance problem. identifying the appropriate level of autonomy or discretion is the second feature our study suggests is important for structuring an internship for learning. given the short time frame mbas have to learn on the job interns figure. goal clarityautonomy two-way interaction human resource management january february human resource management doi. hrm differ from the regular workers studied previously in their capacity to benefit from autonomy. this finding is consistent with prior research on short-term training. when limited time exists to learn new skills and activities directive supervisor feedback can result in greater performancins than participative feedback. mba interns typically have to weeks to learn new activities and fulfill their responsibilities. too much autonomy can divert attention from learning. instead the intern is likely to direct considerable effort searching for ways to get the job done. rushing to complete task at hand can undermine learning by downplaying the value of dead ends and alternative strategies. when lower autonomy reflects the developmental direction that supervisors and coworkers provide interns learning is likely to be better supported. if lack of appropriate structure makes learning in short-term roles more difficult the effects of too much autonomy are even more pronounced when workers are less experienced. less experienced people have limited repertoire of skills activities and related capacities for problem solving and task planning. holding high goal clarity constant less experienced interns reported more learning when autonomy was low than did their more experienced counterparts. for more experienced interns goal clarity had positive rela tionship with learning while autonomy had none. interns provided with clear task goals appeared to need base level of prior experience to reap autonomy learning benefits. as in the case of the exemplary employer described earlier setting internship goals with one supervisor to ensure appropriateness and understanding combines the best of autonomy with goal clarity. participating in setting one own goals may provide sufficient autonomy in work settings where learning needs to occur quickly. goals are not only better understood in such cases but likely to be effective in identifying appropriate task activities and acquiring new skills. the antithesis of the enabling role structure described previously is supervisor who dictates what the intern is supposed to do day to day without explaining why. the least learning occurred where both goal clarity and autonomy were low an effect pronounced for those with little prior experience. combination of rigid activities and not understanding their purpose can stifle learning. the management practices that best promote learning may differ from those suited to use internships as screening devices for employee selection. an employer who primarily values the existing skills an intern possesses is likely to send different signals than an employer seeking an intern with the capacity to learn and perform. where figure. goal clarityautonomyprior experience three-way interaction getting the most from mba internships human resource management doi. hrm recruits value learning opportunities potential employers benefit when their internship practices signal an attractive compelling and skill-enhancing future with the organization. employers whose supportive highly structured roles promote intern learning are likely to allocate considerable resources to feedback guidance and mentoring. employers using the internship as screening device are more likely to create assignments that chall the intern skills risking poor performance to evaluate those skills. the former arrangement may reduce an employer ability to use the intern performance as screening device while the latter can make internship learning more difficult. we suggest that if the internship is used to identify mbas who already possess soughtafter skills using intern performance as selection criterion may undercut the employer ability to attract people who may be highly motivated to learn. employers seeking to hire highly motivated and ambitious mbas may be well advised to use standardized tests and structured interviews to determine the skills that recruits possess.  doing so better positions employers to use internships for learning opportunities that signal to interns an attractive future with the firm. this should improve the firm ability to recruit intern candidates. managing short-term workers our findings have implications beyond mba interns to newcomers in contemporary shortterm professional work arrangements. shortterm workers doing consulting or project work may learn better and faster when their employers provide degrees of autonomy commensurate with their prior experience. experienced consultants and other contingent workers may learn the essentials of their short-term role through combination of clear goals and high autonomy. in contrast where short-term workers are less experienced as is often the case for temporary or seasonal employees different work structure is required.  well-specified activities and clear task goals can help inexperienced short-term workers learn. consequently this structure is also likely to facilitate their overall performance. in contrast to experienced workers who benefit from greater autonomy inexperienced workers require more employer resources to structure their tasks and the work situation appropriately. as such more management time and attention are needed to provide directive feedback and learning opportunities for inexperienced short-term workers. alternatively more effort may be required at first to design work environments in which short-term workers can quickly learn to perform effectively. such is the case in firms that depend on short-term employees performing effectively. mcdonald corporation for example has more than employee turnover in its restaurants. highly structured roles and work environments help workers learn their jobs quickly.  a l v slope difference test for goal

professionals responsible for more complex knowl work fast learning is more difficult to enable by workplace design. instead it may be better achieved by high levels of goal clarity coupled with autonomy commensurate with the individual experience. because contemporary workers can expect variations in goal clarity as they enter new and short-term roles individuals should prepare themselves for task settings with unclear goals or higher than expected autonomy.  role playing case studies and reflecting on prior experiences are some of the strategies that workers can use to prepare for new short-term roles. from the outset of short-term job seeking goal clarity by gathering information regarding expectations from important stakeholders can be critical to both performing and learning effectively. limitations future research and contributions this study has several limitations.  foremost is the fact that causality cannot be determined although two design features increase confidence in the causal direction our hypotheses imply. autonomy was assessed at time prior to the outcomes of learning and job acceptance which were measured at time. job acceptance was measured at both times and permitting our analyses to investigate effects on changes in job acceptance probability. some alternative explanations can also be considered and rejected. although clear task goals appear to help mba interns develop skills on the job an alternative expla nation is that interns attracted to their employer report more learning consistently with both cognitive dissonance and the observed higher learning means associated with preinternship above median job acceptance intentions.  our learning outcome analyses however controlled for initial job acceptance probabilities ruling out response bias as an explanation. indeed participant interviews prior to their internships indicated most were interested in future employment with their summer employer. thus an alternative causal order for thal clarity learning relationship is unlikely. representativeness is also concern. as noted in the sample description earlier respondents demographics are reasonably comparable to their school mba population most of whom undertook an internship. also as noted participating schools were drawn from the first through third tiers of popular mba programs. as such we believe that our sample is representative of the broader population of mba interns. further the short-term nature of mba internships may be representative of broader array of short-term professional work arrangements. most of our measures are self-report raising concerns regarding common method bias. the interaction effects that compose some of our major findings however are less subject to such bias than are main or direct effects. furthermore our prior experience variable was obtained from student resumes and not surveys. prior experience constitutes an indirect measure of task skill repertoire though it is an indicator easily available to prospective intern employer. perceptual bias is another factor particularly with respect to the learning measure where an indicator of objective skill change would be preferred. nonetheless explicit forms of self-reported learning where particular skills are specified have been shown to correspond to objective skill changes. these limitations can be addressed by measuring skill level changes highly structured roles and work environments help workers learn their jobs quickly.  in contrast when short-term workers are professionals responsible for more complex knowl work fast learning is more difficult to enable by workplace design. instead it may be better achieved by high levels of goal clarity coupled with autonomy commensurate with the individual experience.  getting the most from mba internships human resource management doi. hrm over time and comparing them with other indicators of learning. last some potentially relevant factors were not assessed. we used implicit task plans strategies and activities to explain observed effects yet these were not measured.  because our results are consistent with the task plan and strategy constructs and with the logic of scaffolding future studies should measure these constructs directly to test whether our explanations are confirmed. further this study focused on task goal clarity while task goal difficulty may also be factor in both intern learning and performance.  further investigating the relationship between goal difficulty and relevant outcomes for internships and other short-term work would be informative. conclusion this study makes three contributions. first it highlights the importance of task goal clarity and autonomy in structuring mba internships for both learning and job acceptance. second it demonstrates the potentially important relationships task goal clarity has with learning in short-term roles. this itself is an underinvestigated outcome. third it suggests that inexperience can limit the benefits autonomy provides to learning. in doing so the study calls attention to the tradeoffs among goal clarity autonomy and skill learning in the context of mba internships. mba interns are likely to benefit from well-structured internship where their supervisor and related others set clear task goals and provididance regarding the skills and activities needed to complete work products.  structuring an mba intern role should take into account the individual prior experience in determining how much autonomy or ongoing review and feedback are required. the trend among contemporary employers such as genentech and time warner to incorporate mentoring into the mba internship is consistent with our recommendation that high-quality relationship providing mutual goal setting and adjustments to task structuring may be optimal for both intern and employer. our findings have implications beyond mba interns to other newcomers in shortterm professional work arrangements. shortterm workers can learn better and faster when their employers provide degrees of autonomy commensurate with their prior experience. given the least experienced newcomers in this study learned less under higher autonomy these findings are particularly relevant for millennials. this includes current undaduates and those now entering full-time mba programs who have little prior experience. there may well be sweet spot in structuring mba internships and other short-term professional jobs characterized by comparable demands where clear task goals can be achieved by supporting learning in fashion commensurate with the worker experience. \n",
