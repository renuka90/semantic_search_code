zaccaro, rittman, & marks, 2001) and relational lea-\\ndership (uhl-bien, 2006). consistent with the growing emphasis on\\nshort-lived, self-managed groups in which leadership is not ascribed but\\nrather emerges informally (morgeson et al., 2010), we focus on lea-\\ndership emergence – the process by which individuals become influential\\nin the perceptions of others (lord & maher, 1990; schneider & goktepe,\\n1983; taggar, hackett, & saha, 1999). understanding the fine-grained\\ncognitive and social dynamics by which leaders emerge in informal\\ngroup settings is an important piece of the leadership puzzle that can\\n\\noffer us unique insights into the drivers of leader and follower cogni-\\ntions and actions.\\n\\nin the traditional leadership emergence research paradigm, “group\\nparticipants might be measured on a number of traits that could pos-\\nsibly be related to leadership behaviors. members of the group then\\ninteract while carrying out a task. then magic happens and a leader\\nemerges from the group at the end of the discussion period” (guastello,\\n2007, p. 357). thus, leadership emergence is an outcome of an un-\\nmeasured magical process, which we hope to demystify. moreover, this\\nleader-focused perspective does not follow from the current view of\\nleadership as a mutual social influence process. leadership emergence\\ndoes not reside in a person but rather in an interactive dynamic, within\\nwhich any particular person will participate as a leader or a follower at\\ndifferent times and for different purposes. accordingly, we advance the\\nstudy of leadership emergence by conceptualizing emergence from a\\nmultilevel theory and complexity science perspective (kozlowski &\\nklein, 2000; lichtenstein & plowman, 2009; morgeson & hofmann,\\n1999; sawyer, 2001) for the purposes of developing a process oriented\\nperspective of leadership emergence. in a process perspective, the space\\nbetween individuals (uhl-bien & ospina, 2012), developments over\\ntime (day & thornton, 2018), double interacts (derue, 2011), and\\naggregation to group levels (dinh et al., 2014) are as important as the\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.002\\nreceived 20 january 2017;

(2013), “the\\nextent that emergence is shown any attention at all in such research, it\\nis indirect with respect to models of measurement and data aggregation\\nfor representing higher order constructs” (p. 600). by developing an\\nintegrative framework of leadership emergence, we specify the under-\\nlying theoretical rationale for how the elements at the lower level in-\\nteract to create a social structure at the higher level. moreover, we\\ndepict social structure as not just existing at a surface level in terms of\\nfunctional behaviors of leaders, but in terms of deeper constructs such\\nas roles and identities as they develop over time.\\n\\nthe remainder of our review has four sections. first, to organize the\\nreview we conceptualize the leadership emergence process from a\\ncomplexity perspective and define emergence as a dynamic, interactive\\nprocess. in doing so, we introduce three principles of emergent phe-\\nnomena which are derived from previous works on multilevel theory\\n(klein & kozlowski, 2000; kozlowski & klein, 2000; kozlowski et al.,\\n2013). second, we review how previous research has modeled leader-\\nship emergence by focusing on the content areas of the lower-level\\nelements, the mechanisms that facilitate their emergence, and the dy-\\nnamism of the process once it has emerged. third, based on the findings\\nfrom the review, we develop a process-oriented framework of leader-\\nship emergence that builds on prior work (e.g., derue, 2011) and ex-\\ntends it to a deeper level. fourth, we offer suggestions to guide devel-\\noping and testing emergent leadership processes, and we conclude with\\nrecommendations for future leadership process research.\\n\\nemergence theory\\n\\nthe relationship between the individual and the collective is a\\nfundamental one. the notion of emergence has a long history with roots\\nin the philosophy of science, biology, physics, sociology, and more re-\\ncently, it has been integrated with complexity theory (see sawyer, 2001\\nand kozlowski et al., 2013 for reviews). new research on chaos\\n(guastello, 2007), self-organization (vallacher, van geert, & nowak,\\n2015), adaptive systems (grossberg, 2013), nonlinear dynamics\\n(newell & molenar, 2014), and artificial life (olson, knoester, & adami,\\n2016) are all part of this growing interest in complex systems. the in-\\nterest has spread from the scientific community to popular culture, with\\nthe publication of general interest books about research into complex\\nsystems (holland, 1995, 1998).\\n\\naccording to the philosopher david blitz (1992), the term ‘emer-\\ngent’ was coined by the pioneer psychologist g. h. lewes (1874a,\\n1874b). emergence is one of the most ubiquitous processes, and yet one\\nof the least understood. this has resulted in many different perspectives\\nand definitions of emergence. recently, goldstein (1999, 2000) iden-\\ntified six properties of emergent phenomena across disciplines: quali-\\ntative novelty (features not previously observed at the micro level),\\ncoherence (integrated wholes that maintain identity over time), global/\\nmacro level (locus of the phenomena at a higher level), dynamic (new\\nattractors arise over time), ostensive (recognizable phenomena), and\\nsupervenience (the asymmetrical relation between two levels). in\\ncomplex systems, self-organization is the process through which order\\nin the form of new structures arises from disorder and entropy at lower\\nlevels. according to hirsh, mar, and peterson (2012), if the environ-\\nment changes to produce greater entropy for a system thus challenging\\nits structural coherence, then that system must adopt new patterns of\\nself-organization that are capable of accommodating the environmental\\nchanges. emergent phenomena are the self-generated novel structures\\nthat confer adaptability to complex systems. thus, from an emergence\\nperspective, we define leadership emergence as the multilevel interac-\\ntional process driven by deep level cognitive and perceptual processes of\\ngroup members that form a collective patterning of leader and follower in-\\nteractions over time.\\n\\nin the area of social emergence, sawyer (2001) contrasts two\\nemergence paradigms, similar to bedau's (1997) notion of strong vs.\\nweak emergence. the first paradigm is collective emergence, which\\nholds that group behavior is constituted by individual action, yet\\ncannot be reduced to the individual level. this holistic view of emer-\\ngence argues that emergent phenomena result in qualitative changes\\nthat are different from, and irreducible to, their parts. this con-\\nceptualization is consistent with emergence principles in philosophy\\n(epstein, 1999), sociology (durkheim, 1895; durkheim, 1964), and\\nphysics (anderson, 1972), as well general systems theory (von\\nbertalanffy, 1956; von bertalanffy, 1968).\\n\\nthe second paradigm is individualist emergence, which accepts the\\nexistence of emergent phenomena; however, the emergent outcome can\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n146\\n\\n\\n\\nalways be reduced to individuals and their relationships (russell,\\n1927). this conceptualization is consistent with how social properties\\nemerge from individual action (axelrod, 1997; homans, 1958). classic\\nexamples of this second conceptualization of emergence include traffic\\njams (wilensky & resnick, 1999) and bird flocks (reynolds, 1987). for\\nexample, the bird flock emerges out of three simple interaction rules\\nfollowed by individual birds: (1) avoid collisions, (2) match speeds with\\nyour neighbors, and (3) move towards the center of mass of your\\nneighbors. no central director or leader is needed. the flocking is\\nemergent because it is not caused by any one bird but by all the birds\\ninteracting together; the formation in the flocking is made up of all the\\nbirds but “transcends” them as well. both conceptualizations of emer-\\ngence agree on the importance of analyzing processes of emergence\\nthrough time. importantly, corning (2012) reconciles these two posi-\\ntions by positing that reductionism, or detailed analysis of the parts and\\ntheir interactions, is essential for answering the “how” question;\\nwhereas, holism is equally necessary for answering the “why” question.\\nin order to answer the “why” question, a broader, multileveled para-\\ndigm is required.\\n\\nthus, the notion of levels is central to understanding the emergent\\nphenomena. as noted by kozlowski et al. (2013), “the goal is to un-\\nderstand the process of emergence through system dynamics across\\nmultiple levels – simultaneously” (p. 585). similarly, leadership re-\\nsearch highlights the multilevel nature of the construct (derue, 2011;\\nlord & dinh, 2014). we use wiley's (1988) notion of four levels of\\nsubjectivity to bridge the micro to the macro level and to deduce the\\nprocess mechanisms inherent in micro-level dynamics that yield the\\nhigher level phenomenon. wiley's four levels of subjectivity allow a\\nbetter understanding and appreciation of the fundamentally interactive\\nnature of leadership emergence through an emphasis on the importance\\nof interaction, structure, and context. the different levels discussed by\\nwiley are: (1) intrasubjective (individual), (2) intersubjective (inter-\\nactive), (3) generic subjective (social) and (4) extrasubjective (macro-\\nculture).\\n\\nthe first level, intrasubjective, is concerned with the constantly\\nemerging nature of the self. at this level, characteristics of the in-\\ndividual are expected to vary systematically within person, across\\nevents, or over time, as in the development of a leadership identity. the\\nnext level – intersubjective level is primarily one of interaction and\\nconcerns the relation and impact of one individual to another. of all the\\nlevels involved in leadership, the one arguably most in need of ad-\\nvancement is the dyad, which according to yammarino and gooty\\n(2017), is “the most neglected and poorly understood level of analysis\\nin leadership research” (p. 229). the intersubjective level moves be-\\nyond any single individual and is “emergent upon the interchange and\\nsynthesis of two, or more, communicating selves” (wiley, 1988, p. 258).\\nat this level, the process as well as the substance of leadership sense-\\nmaking is shaped during interactions. as wiley notes, however, the\\nintersubjective level is often neglected in social theory, yet seems es-\\nsential to describe powerful influences on sensegiving and sensemaking\\nessential to leadership emergence. the level above interaction is that of\\nsocial structure. generic subjective focuses on the demands, constraints,\\nand objectives placed on the individual as a function of the immediate\\nsocial setting. the generic subjective occurs as concrete selves are left\\nbehind and the understanding is seen as “a reified social structure, in-\\ncluding interaction patterns, role relationships, common purpose, and\\ntaken-for-granted beliefs” (ashforth, rogers, & corley, 2011, p. 1146)\\nwhich often reflect a group identity (van knippenberg, 2018). finally,\\nthe most abstract level is the extrasubjective level of culture. at this\\nlevel, focus shifts from the subjective experiences of individuals to pure\\nmeaning, which is an abstract idealized reality.\\n\\nwe believe the study of emergent leadership phenomena is ripe for\\nfurther exploration using the insights of complexity perspectives on\\nemergence and wiley's idea of the leveled character of social reality.\\ngiven that emergent phenomena are multilevel and process-oriented,\\nwe use both of these perspectives to introduce three emergence\\n\\nprinciples, which served as foci for our review of the leadership\\nemergence literature. to be clear, these principles are not new and are\\nlargely derived from previous works within multilevel theory\\n(kozlowski & klein, 2000), which have been used primarily to further\\nthe study of group/team dynamics. in relying on these works, we first\\nidentify the individual-level elements at which leadership emergence is\\nthought to originate. the individual level elements are analogous to\\nwiley's conceptualization of the self. then we identify the process\\nmechanisms by which the individual elements are integrated, bridging\\nwiley's levels of intersubjective and generic subjective. finally,\\nkozlowski et al. (2013) also discuss the importance of addressing the\\npotential variation in the emergent outcome over time and we include\\nthis aspect as the third principle. as we do this, we pay particular at-\\ntention to deeper levels of emerging structures such as relational and\\ncollective identities (brewer & gardner, 1996) because they often\\nsupport more obvious surface structures such as social exchanges\\n(flynn, 2005) and leadership behavior (johnson, venus, lanaj, mao, &\\nchang, 2012).\\n\\nfinally, it is important to note that, while not explicitly incorporated\\ninto these emergence principles, the leadership emergence process is\\nexpected to be situated within a greater context of both informal re-\\nlationships as well as formal organizational structures. as kozlowski\\net al. (2013) note, “although it is not a core characteristic of emergence\\nper se, contextual factors at the higher-level shape and constrain the\\nprocess dynamics of emergence” (p. 585). in our review and subsequent\\nintegrative framework, we focus on identifying the central principles\\nthat drive the bottom-up process of leadership emergence. accordingly,\\nwhile not within the aims of this paper, we do acknowledge that these\\nemergence principles are situated within a greater organizational con-\\ntext.\\n\\nemergence principle #1: elemental properties of the emergent process\\n\\naccording to multilevel theory, every emergence process is char-\\nacterized by its lower-level elements or components. elements can re-\\npresent everything from neurons and cognitions to attitudes, behaviors,\\ninformation, and events, which meaningfully impact the emergence\\nprocess (kozlowski et al., 2013; morgeson & hofmann, 1999; roberts,\\nhulin, & rousseau, 1978; vallacher et al., 2015). these elemental\\nproperties are critical to understanding an emergent process because\\nthey serve as the micro-level building blocks to a higher-level outcome\\n(klein & kozlowski, 2000). elemental properties represent the in-\\ntrasubjective level of wiley's (1988) theory of levels. leadership\\nemergence theories that address this component of emergence serve to\\nanswer the questions of what elements are relevant to the emergence\\nprocess, how much of each element impacts the process, and what type\\nof effect it is has on the emergence process.\\n\\nemergence principle #2: mechanisms involved in the emergence process\\n\\nidentifying the elemental properties by themselves only captures the\\nlower-level “ingredients” to the emergence process, but it does not\\ncapture how and why these various elements function together to form\\nthe higher-level emergent outcome. according to multilevel theory, in\\norder to have an understanding of the process of emergence, it is ne-\\ncessary to both define what the elemental properties are as well as to\\ndefine the processes by which they are coordinated (cronin, weingart,\\n& todorova, 2011; kozlowski & klein, 2000). self-organization pro-\\nvides an explanation for the emergence of higher-order patterns as in-\\ndividual elements adjust to one another (vallacher et al., 2015). self-\\norganization is rarely a one-step process, but rather typically involves\\nmany iterations of mutual adjustment among elements before they are\\nsufficiently organized to promote a system-level property (hopfield,\\n1984). similar to wiley's (1988) intersubjective level of interaction, the\\nelements are transformed through interaction. in order for a theory to\\nsatisfy emergence principle two, specific works must outline the “rules”\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\n\\nthat determine how the leadership emergence process unfolds. more-\\nover, mechanisms can occur at various levels (lichtenstein, 2014),\\nwhich allows researchers to make links across multiple units of analysis,\\nsuch that insights from one level might be applied to others.\\n\\nemergence principle #3: form/function of the emergence outcome\\n\\nany emergence process cannot be adequately understood without\\ndefining the appropriate form/function of the eventual outcome.\\nkozlowski and klein (2000) made a point of emphasizing that emergent\\noutcomes are not fixed, but variable in nature; they often evolve and\\nchange. thus, the third principle is critical in understanding an emer-\\ngent process because it describes the dynamics of the phenomenon after\\nit has emerged. according to kozlowski (2015), while emergent phe-\\nnomena like leadership emergence are often treated as stable once they\\nemerge, they may in fact demonstrate “within-team variability over\\ntime, growth trajectories, and/or other types of trajectories (i.e., cy-\\ncles)” (p. 275). this idea is consistent with wiley's (1988) notion that\\nemergence does not just happen once and then stop, as well as\\nlichtenstein's (2014) distinction between dynamic states and emergent\\noutcomes. it can also be seen in the notion of leadership functions being\\nspread across group members (morgeson et al., 2010) or across orga-\\nnizations (dechurch et al., 2011) and time.\\n\\ntherefore, when theorizing about an emergent process, it is critical\\nto incorporate these temporal considerations, which involve the emer-\\ngent outcome after it has emerged. in order for a theory or research to\\nsatisfy emergence principle three, it also must describe the changes in\\nthe emergent outcome over time. this can include the form of change\\nthat the outcome demonstrates (e.g. discrete, non-linear changes), and\\nother temporal characteristics of the outcome (e.g. how quickly changes\\noccur). kozlowski et al. (2013) state that both the emergent process and\\nresulting outcome cannot be fully understood without discussing one\\nanother. accordingly, the elements (principle one), the interactions\\n(principle two) and the dynamics of the emergent outcome (principle\\nthree) are all necessary to gain a complete understanding of any\\nemergent property. overall, by applying these three principles derived\\nfrom multilevel theory to the study of leadership emergence, we argue\\nthat important insights can be gained regarding the underlying pro-\\ncesses driving leadership emergence.\\n\\nsystematic review and article mapping\\n\\nto perform the review, the existing leadership emergence literature\\nwas mapped onto the three emergence principles. we first performed an\\nextensive electronic literature search using web of science. specifically,\\nwe searched for the following terms in the title, abstract, and keywords\\nof articles: “leadership emergence”, “leader emergence”, “emergent\\nleadership”, “emergent leader”, “leadership process”, “leadership dy-\\nnamics”, “multilevel leadership”, “informal leadership”, “shared lea-\\ndership”, “distributed leadership”, and “team leadership”, and elimi-\\nnated any sources not related to psychology or business. articles from\\nother areas were included if they were deemed to make a unique con-\\ntribution to understanding the process of leadership and were con-\\nsistent with the psychology and business literature in their con-\\nceptualization of emergence. this original search list included 709\\narticles. then, using the references from these articles, we identified\\nand included any additional articles that were not in the initial search if\\nthey specifically discussed leadership emergence. our final sample in-\\ncluded articles published between 1941 and 2016.\\n\\nnext, we applied the following selection criteria. first, articles had\\nto be original research, whether qualitative, quantitative, theoretical, or\\nmethodological, thus eliminating works such as letters, editorials, and\\nbook chapters. review articles were only included if they made specific\\ncontributions to understanding leadership emergence beyond sum-\\nmarizing what previous works found. second, we eliminated articles\\nbased upon their relevance to leadership emergence. to do so, we first\\n\\nremoved articles that did not include information about leadership\\nperceptions or the development of collective leadership as an outcome.\\nfinally, any article that was primarily focused on formal leaders, or did\\nnot discuss informal leadership, was removed. after eliminating articles\\nthat did not fit the above criteria, 189 articles remained (a full list of the\\narticles considered and chosen is available upon request).\\n\\nmapping procedure and categories\\n\\narticle information\\nwe created a database including year, journal, authors, and the title\\n\\nof the journal article. additionally, articles were recorded as empirical\\nor conceptual, and within the empirical category, they were recorded as\\neither longitudinal or cross-sectional. to be clear, we relied on a stricter\\ndefinition of longitudinal, in that articles had to include the leadership\\nemergence outcome for at least three time points, following previous\\nrecommendations (ployhart & vandenberg, 2010; singer & willett,\\n2003).\\n\\nprinciples\\nthe first and fourth authors mapped articles to the three emergence\\n\\nprinciples previously described. they reviewed the first 100 articles\\nfrom the original list together to obtain sufficient evidence of agree-\\nment in the article review process, then continued reviewing and\\nmapping the remaining articles independently. after eliminating all\\nnon-emergence articles, the remaining 189 were mapped onto the three\\nemergence principles (elements, process mechanisms, and form/func-\\ntion of the emergent outcome) using the criteria described below.\\n\\nspecifically, an article was identified as fitting principle one if it\\nidentified an individual characteristic (i.e. element) that impacts lea-\\ndership emergence. specifically, these were person-level properties that\\nwere described as having an effect on who emerged as a leader/fol-\\nlower (i.e. not simply a control variable). consistent with hollander's\\n(1974) treatment of “leadership elements”, we mapped each element as\\neither leader-focused or follower-focused (or both). an article was\\nmapped onto principle two if it described and/or tested the process of\\nleadership emergence. this principle included articles that described\\nthe phases or steps leading to leadership emergence and identified the\\nmechanisms which focus on the “how” of leadership emergence. in\\naddition, we identified the specific process mechanisms described in\\neach principle two paper (between two and four mechanisms); we then\\ncategorized each mechanism across the three primary levels of emer-\\ngence (individual, relational, or collective). next, we grouped the\\nprocess mechanisms identified in all articles into subcategories within\\neach level. finally, an article was mapped onto principle three if it\\nexamined or described the temporal dynamics of leadership emergence\\nover time. this included both the form of change and other char-\\nacteristics of the outcome over time (e.g. linearity).\\n\\nprinciples were not considered mutually exclusive, as articles could\\nfit multiple principles. for example, hall, workman, and marchioro\\n(1998) investigated both the gender of the leader, as well as the be-\\nhavioral flexibility and information processing that occurs within the\\nprocess of informal leadership perceptions; thus, this article was\\nmapped onto both principle one and principle two. similarly, sub-ca-\\ntegories within principles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. for\\ninstance, in principle one, articles may have described multiple ele-\\nments of leader emergence (e.g. personality and gender).\\n\\nresults of the systematic review\\n\\noverall, principle one represented the largest category, containing\\n139 articles. principle two contained 47 articles, and principle three\\ncontained 28 articles (see fig. 1).1 not surprisingly, there was an\\n\\n1 this total exceeds 189 because 12% of articles were mapped onto more than\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n148\\n\\n\\n\\nincreasing trend of publications on leadership emergence over time\\nfrom 1941 to 2016 (see fig. 1). articles were mainly empirical (157) as\\nopposed to conceptual. within the empirical articles, they were mainly\\ncross-sectional (137), as opposed to longitudinal.\\n\\nprinciple #1\\nof the 139 total articles representing principle one, 95% were em-\\n\\npirical, and only 7% of the empirical articles were longitudinal. the\\noverwhelming majority of articles included leader elements (137), with\\nonly 11 including follower elements. there were nine articles that\\ncontained both follower and leader elements. when categorizing the\\nelements into smaller subcategories (for both follower and leader ele-\\nments), personality (n=46), gender (n=43), and behavior (n=38)\\nwere the three most prevalent elements investigated. over time, the\\nfrequency of behavioral elements was the most consistent across years,\\nwith a noticeable proportion between the years of 1950–1979.\\nadditionally, studies which included behavioral elements noticeably\\nincreased from 1990 to 1999, decreased from 2000 to 2009, before\\nrising again in recent years. the study of gender as an element in-\\ncreased a large amount from 1980 to 1999 before remaining stable from\\n2000 to 2009 and then decreasing from 2010 to 2016. finally, the\\nfrequency of personality as an element increased substantially over the\\nyears of 1990–2009 and has remained relatively stable. overall, the\\nfrequency of principle one articles has increased over time. for a list of\\nthe major element subcategories along with the associated findings, see\\ntable 1.\\n\\nprinciple #2\\nthere were a total of 47 articles mapped onto principle two. of the\\n\\nprinciple two articles, 53% were conceptual, and of the empirical ar-\\nticles, 32% were longitudinal. when examining the level of the emer-\\ngent process, we found that 21 of the articles included individual-level\\nprocess mechanisms, 40 included relational-level process mechanisms,\\nand 27 articles included collective-level process mechanisms. many of\\n\\nthe articles discussed the process mechanisms at more than one level,\\nwith 16 articles at the individual and relational level, 14 articles at the\\nrelational and collective level, and five articles being mapped on all\\nthree levels.\\n\\nat each of the three levels of the emergence process, we grouped\\nprocess mechanisms into subcategories by identifying common themes.\\nwe developed the subcategories by identifying the process mechanisms\\nthat were conceptually similar and were discussed as holding a similar\\npurpose within the emergence process. when examining the 21 process\\nmechanisms at the individual level, the top two process mechanism sub-\\ncategories were self-schema/identity work (12) and task contribution (6).\\nwhen examining the 59 process mechanisms at the relational level, the\\ntop two process mechanisms were adapting to follower/task expectations\\n(23), and leadership prototype activation (10). finally, when examining\\nthe 46 process mechanisms at the collective level, the top three process\\nmechanisms were collective patterning of interactions (12), resolving ten-\\nsions (10), and social identification (6). overall, the frequency of prin-\\nciple two articles generally increased over time. a list of the major\\ntheoretical perspectives which discussed the process of leadership\\nemergence, along with their primary process mechanisms, organized by\\nlevel, appears in table 2.\\n\\nprinciple #3\\nthere were a total of 28 articles that mapped onto principle three.\\n\\nof those articles, 18% were conceptual and of the empirical articles,\\n48% were longitudinal. from the various findings in principle three,\\nthree themes were identified: (1) dynamism of leadership emergence\\nover time (n=17), (2) the form of change (i.e. linearity) (n=11), and\\n(3) the life cycle of the team (n=7). overall, the frequency of principle\\nthree articles increased sharply from 1970 to 2009 before decreasing\\nslightly from 2010 to 2016. a full list of the principle three findings\\nappears in table 3.\\n\\ngeneral themes\\nfrom the initial findings, we identified general themes and trends\\n\\nfor the principles. across all articles, twice as many articles were ca-\\ntegorized as principle one,

research\\n(dinh et al., 2014), these results suggest an overemphasis on the role of\\nperson factors on leadership emergence and an underemphasis on\\nprocess mechanisms and the dynamics of the construct.\\n\\nfor principle one, the articles were leader-focused, with most of the\\nelements centered on personality, behavior, and gender. in contrast,\\narticles that were mapped onto principle two emphasized the role of the\\nfollower; at the relational level, adapting to follower expectations was one\\nof the most frequent process mechanism subcategories identified,\\nhighlighting the importance of the follower in the leadership process.\\nthis evidence provides further support for the increasing importance of\\nthe study of followership (uhl-bien, riggio, lowe, & carsten, 2014).\\noverall, principle two had the greatest percentage of conceptual articles\\ncompared to the other principles. we presume this was due to the\\ncomplexity of studying leadership process mechanisms empirically\\n(fischer, dietz, & antonakis, 2016).\\n\\nprinciple three had the most limited work. these articles were\\nmainly mapped as empirical. although a main component of this\\nprinciple required a discussion of the emergent state over time, many of\\nthe articles did not assess informal leadership longitudinally (using our\\ncriteria). overall, the results from principle three reflect the field's lack\\nof exploration of time (day, 2014), as well as a lack of discussion about\\nthe form change in emergence (wang, zhou, & liu, 2014).\\n\\nintegrative framework of leadership emergence\\n\\nas the results from the literature review illustrate, 25% of papers\\ndiscussed the underlying process mechanisms of leadership emergence\\n(see table 2). by using the information gathered primarily from these\\nworks, we now introduce our process-oriented framework of leadership\\nemergence which aims to address three major objectives. first, as a\\ncentral component of any emergent process is its multilevel nature\\n(kozlowski et al., 2013), we incorporate all three levels (individual,\\nrelational, and collective) of leadership emergence into our theoretical\\nframework. although previous theories have discussed informal lea-\\ndership processes across multiple levels (derue & ashford, 2010), our\\nreview indicated that previous theories tended to focus on one or two of\\nthese levels, rather than incorporate all levels (derue, 2011 being a\\nnotable exception); this tendency reflects trends found in the leadership\\nliterature as a whole (batistič, černe, & vogel, 2017). accordingly, in\\nour theoretical framework, we include mechanisms that have been\\ndiscussed primarily at the individual level (e.g. self-schema activation),\\nrelational level (e.g. claiming & granting), and collective level (e.g.\\ntension reduction) in one comprehensive framework of leadership\\nemergence.\\n\\nsecond, as emergent properties are defined by the mechanisms that\\ndrive the bottom-up process (kozlowski et al., 2013), we structure our\\ntheoretical framework to incorporate the most frequently occurring\\nprocess mechanisms, as identified in the review, starting at the in-\\ndividual level. from doing so, we identify the two fundamental me-\\nchanisms of leadership emergence: self-structures and enacted\\n\\nstructures. we elaborate on these specific categories in the following\\nsection.\\n\\nthe format of the framework is as follows. we first introduce the\\ncategories of self-structures and enacted structures which are used to\\ndescribe the fundamental mechanisms in the emergence process. next,\\nwe describe the emergence process as it occurs across levels, over time.\\nacross these three levels, we describe the process first in terms of the\\nrole of self-structural properties, followed by the role of enacted\\nstructural properties in the system. we incorporate the most common\\nprocess mechanisms and theories for each level, as was found in the\\nreview. finally, in developing a process-oriented framework, we in-\\ntroduce propositions that could be used to guide future empirical esti-\\nmation and the development of testable formal models (see grand et al.,\\n2016 and vancouver, weinhardt, & schmidt, 2010 for examples). we\\nbegin this process by providing specific propositions that represent the\\nemergence process at each level. these propositions are listed in\\ntable 4.\\n\\nfundamental mechanisms\\n\\nin describing the basic nature of organizations, weick (1979) stated\\nthat they are made up of “interlocked behaviors that are embedded in\\nconditionally related processes” (p. 2). this reflects the findings of the\\nliterature review, as papers described the emergence process in prin-\\nciple two using the mechanisms of either behaviors and subsequent\\ninteractions occurring across individuals, or the deeper-level self and\\ninformation processes occurring within individuals which reflect their\\nongoing interactions (see table 2). specifically, we labeled these two\\ncategories of leadership emergence mechanisms as self-structures and\\nenacted structures. self-structures refer to cognitions related to how\\nindividuals produce, process, and understand information about the self\\n(e.g. self-identity, self-schema, self-concept; nowak, vallacher, tesser,\\n& borkowski, 2000). enacted structures refer to the behaviors, ex-\\npressions, and communications that are performed to support an on-\\ngoing social construction process between leaders and followers\\n(weick, 1995). we believe self-schemas and self-identities reflect the\\ndeep structure of leadership emergence because they are a fundamental\\ninput into self-regulation (lord & brown, 2004; markus & wurf, 1987);\\nself-regulation in turn, produces adaptive behaviors (kanfer, frese, &\\njohnson, 2017), which we view as the surface structure indication of\\nleadership emergence. according to lord, gatti, and chui (2016), the\\nsensemaking perspective helps move beyond the static view of “lea-\\ndership as individuals” to a richer understanding of leadership as a\\nsocially constructed process that is situationally embedded, and occurs\\nacross multiple levels, over time. for example, ashforth and schinoff\\n(2016) emphasize the situational embeddedness and social construction\\nof identities as being part of a sensemaking process. thus, by using the\\norganizational sensemaking literature to organize the results from the\\nliterature review, previous theories describing separate processes oc-\\ncurring at different levels can be integrated into a complete, bottom-up\\nrepresentation of

acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\n\\nemergence of both surface and deep structures.\\nas theories describing organizational sensemaking continued to\\n\\ndevelop, the idea of organizational “sensegiving” was added to re-\\npresent a complementary process to sensemaking. we argue that both\\nsensemaking and sensegiving are central processes necessary to un-\\nderstand the leadership emergence process. sensemaking represents the\\nprocess by which individuals perceive and ultimately organize complex\\ninformation into a coherent narrative (weick, sutcliffe, & obstfeld,\\n2005), and the narrative they construct often reflects their personal\\nidentity-work (ibarra & barbulescu, 2010). in contrast, sensegiving re-\\npresents the process by which a constructed meaning is conveyed to\\nothers (hill & levenhagen, 1995), and this may also be reflected in\\nstories from which authentic leadership is inferred by others (shamir &\\neilam, 2005). sensegiving becomes particularly important within a\\ncollective leadership context where each individual has enacted a un-\\nique understanding of leadership and followership. as sensegiving\\nconcerns how individuals influence others into adapting their definition\\nof organization reality (gioia & chittipeddi, 1991), we incorporate both\\nsensegiving and sensemaking into the enacted structure portion of our\\ntheoretical framework in describing the process by which individuals\\ndevelop a shared reality of leadership. finally, although both sense-\\nmaking and sensegiving help an individual construct their individual\\nmeaning within a collective (i.e. self-processes), both are viewed as\\nsocial activities (maitlis, 2005), in that individuals use action to con-\\nstruct both self-understandings (sensemaking), as well as shape the\\nunderstandings of others (sensegiving). therefore, while sensegiving\\nand sensemaking inform both self-structures and enacted structures,\\nthey occur within the processes related to enacted structures.\\n\\nthroughout the explication of our process-oriented theoretical fra-\\nmework of leadership emergence, table 5 is intended to serve as a vi-\\nsual representation. this table illustrates the specific self-structural\\nchanges and enacted structural changes that occur in a hypothetical\\nfour-person group (a, b, c, d). this table is also intended to represent\\nthe progression from the individual to the relational to the collective\\nlevels.\\n\\nindividual level\\n\\nself-structures\\n\\nthe largest portion of the theories at the individual level (57%)\\ndiscussed the role of self-views, self-schema, and self-identity (emery,\\ndaniloski, & hamby, 2011; hall & lord, 1995; lord, brown, & freiberg,\\n1999). according to these perspectives, how individuals proceed to act\\nas both leaders and followers within a collective is largely a function of\\nhow they view themselves as a leader within a given domain (hannah,\\nwoolfolk, & lord, 2009). according to this view, individuals have ex-\\npectations for leadership prior to interacting with others. work on\\nleader and follower identity suggests that individuals specifically rely\\non self-schemas, which are cognitive structures that shape the affective,\\ncognitive, and behavioral responses of individuals in each context (lord\\net al., 1999; markus & wurf, 1987). self-schemas are domain specific\\n(e.g. leadership domain), and they serve to help individuals retrieve\\nnecessary information to adapt to changing goals within a given social\\ncontext (cross & markus, 1994). therefore, some individuals will have\\na self-schema for leadership, and these self-schemas will guide both\\ntheir perceptions of others and their behavioral responses within a\\nleadership context.\\n\\na critical understanding about self-schemas is that they are acti-\\nvated by specific situational cues and primes (lord et al., 2016).\\ntherefore, depending on the particular social context, people will shift\\nbetween leader and follower schemas (i.e. only one will be activated at\\na particular moment). for example, if a

environment and the other\\nindividuals within the collective (i.e. social situation).\\n\\nin addition, previous research has demonstrated that there will be\\nmeaningful between-person variability in the strength of self-schema\\nwithin a given domain depending on the prior experience of in-\\ndividuals. according to markus (1977), the strength of a self-schema is\\nindicated by the extent that individuals can: (a) process information\\nabout the self in the given domain with relative ease, (b) retrieve be-\\nhavioral evidence from the domain, (c) predict their own future beha-\\nvior in the domain, and (d) resist counter schematic information about\\nthemselves. individuals that have a well-developed leadership self-\\nschema would be high on these factors and would be viewed as\\n“schematic” in the leadership domain (lord et al., 1999). this point is\\ncritical as research shows that the relative strength of leadership self-\\nschemas meaningfully impacts whether people will adopt leadership\\nroles (smith, brown, lord, & engle, 1998) or produce leadership be-\\nhaviors (johnson et al., 2012). accordingly, we argue that individuals\\n\\nwith a more developed leadership self-schema related to a given context\\nwill be more likely to enact a leadership role early in the leadership\\nemergence process.\\n\\nfinally, by adopting recent process approaches to leader identity\\n(lord et al., 2016), further understanding can be generated about the\\nrole of self-structures in the leadership emergence process by differ-\\nentiating them from self-identities. specifically, although previous\\nworks discuss leader and follower identity as critical self-structures in\\nthe emergence process (e.g. emery et al., 2011), more recent works\\nsuggest that leader identities do not develop until an individual's lea-\\ndership self-schema becomes contextualized into the ongoing social\\nprocesses within the collective (epitropaki et al., 2017; lord et al.,\\n2016; lord & chui, 2017).\\n\\nas this conscious, situated identity is constructed, each person uses\\ntheir previous experience, self-schema, and salient values to enact an\\nidentity that is

structure emergence has individual, relational, and collec-\\ntive identity consequences. our review extends this idea by empha-\\nsizing that identity development involves a deeper structure than lea-\\ndership claims and social grants of leadership discussed by derue and\\nashford (2010). constructing situated identities in any area, including\\nleadership, is a complex self-regulatory process that engages many self-\\nmotives, involves affect and cognitive processes, and involves crafting a\\nself-narrative that will be socially accepted. interestingly, individuals\\nhave dedicated neural structures, called default networks, for\\ngrounding the self in task, social, and historical contexts (raichle et al.,\\n2001).\\n\\nin representing the role of self-structures early in the leadership\\nemergence process, it is important to incorporate the factors that will\\nimpact the activation of a specific leader self-schema within a context.\\nalthough concepts such as gender are central to the self-concept of most\\nindividuals and are therefore chronically available (markus, crane,\\nbernstein, & siladi, 1982), leader self-schemas are not presumed to be\\nchronically available, but instead are activated as a function of addi-\\ntional factors (lord et al., 1999). first, as previously described, leader\\nand follower schema activation will be a function of both the task and\\nthe other individuals in the collective—what we label as the social si-\\ntuation. to be clear, as these are informal adhoc groups, at this point in\\nthe emergence process, other informal relational structures have not\\ndeveloped yet (e.g. friendship network; carter et al., 2015). thus, in the\\nschema activation process, the social situation reflects what is described\\nas a self-focused dynamic construal process in which the individual uses\\ncues related to the task and the individuals within their group, to ac-\\ntivate a specific self-schema (freeman & ambady, 2011). these cues\\n(e.g. race of others, task requirements) make up the social context\\nvariable, and can be described as what oc (2018) labeled as discrete task\\nand social factors. second, research suggests that the activation of par-\\nticular self-schemas is impacted by whether individuals are motivated\\nto process self-related information (bober & grolnick, 1995). for ex-\\nample, within the leadership context, individuals that are more com-\\nmitted to collective or organizational goals are more likely to activate\\nappropriate leadership self-schemas (lord et al., 2016). this individual-\\nlevel cognitive structure can differ among group members reflecting a\\ndynamic group level leadership structure or mental model, a point we\\nwill return to later.\\n\\nbased on the above rationale we now turn to the first step in de-\\nveloping specific propositions which represent aspects of the micro\\nprocesses associated with leadership emergence. although the various\\npropositions operate holistically and reflect the dynamics of a complex\\nsystem, they necessarily must be developed individually. thus, while\\nmultiple individuals can emerge simultaneously within a collective, we\\nstart by focusing on individuals. we begin by representing the process\\nof leadership self-schema activation for one person at a specific time\\npoint using the following proposition.\\n\\nproposition 1. the activation of a leadership self-schema at a particular\\npoint in time will depend on context at that time, prior experience in similar\\ncontexts, and motivational states.\\n\\nas noted by epitropaki et al. (2017) and derue (2011), at the in-\\ndividual level, the dynamic interplay between leader-follower identities\\nis critical. thus, in addition to schemas regarding leadership, self-\\nschemas regarding followership are equally important. we posit that\\nthe activation of a follower self-schema is based on factors similar to\\nthose specified in proposition 1.\\n\\nproposition 2. : the activation of a followership self-schema at a particular\\npoint in time will depend on context at that time, prior experience in similar\\ncontexts, and motivational states.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nat the individual level, the primary process mechanism underlyingta\\nbl\\ne\\n5\\n\\nem\\ner\\nge\\n\\nnc\\ne,\\n\\nse\\nns\\neg\\n\\niv\\nin\\ng,\\n\\nse\\nns\\nem\\n\\nak\\nin\\ng,\\n\\nan\\nd\\nse\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\nin\\n\\n4-\\npe\\n\\nrs\\non\\n\\ngr\\nou\\n\\nps\\n(a\\n\\n,b\\n,c\\n\\n,d\\n).\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\ntr\\nuc\\n\\ntu\\nre\\n\\nen\\nac\\nte\\nd\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne\\n\\na\\n's\\nse\\n\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nb\\n's\\nse\\n\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nid\\nen\\n\\nti\\nty\\n\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nse\\n\\nns\\neg\\n\\niv\\nin\\ng\\n\\nse\\nns\\n\\nem\\nak\\n\\nin\\ng\\n\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nof\\n\\nan\\nal\\nys\\n\\nis\\nc\\non\\n\\nte\\nxt\\nua\\n\\nlly\\npr\\nim\\n\\ned\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\n\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nor\\n\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\n\\nac\\nti\\nva\\n\\nte\\nd\\n\\nin\\ndi\\nvi\\ndu\\n\\nal\\nle\\n\\nad\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nen\\nac\\ntm\\n\\nen\\nt\\nba\\n\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nm\\nat\\nch\\n\\nto\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\nan\\n\\nd\\nco\\n\\nnt\\nex\\nt\\n(a\\n\\n)\\nin\\ndi\\nvi\\ndu\\n\\nal\\n\\nso\\nci\\nal\\nly\\n\\nco\\nnfi\\n\\nrm\\ned\\n\\n(o\\nr\\n\\nre\\nje\\nct\\ned\\n\\n)\\nse\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\nac\\nti\\nva\\n\\nte\\nd\\nto\\n\\nsu\\npp\\n\\nor\\nt\\nco\\n\\nnfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nof\\n\\na\\n's\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nr\\nel\\nat\\nio\\nna\\n\\nl(\\nro\\nle\\n\\nre\\nla\\nti\\non\\n\\nsh\\nip\\ns\\nde\\n\\nfi\\nne\\n\\nso\\nci\\nal\\n\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne)\\n\\nc\\non\\n\\nfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nor\\n\\nde\\nni\\nal\\n\\nof\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nac\\nt\\n\\nba\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nm\\nat\\nch\\n\\nto\\nb'\\ns\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne\\nr\\nel\\nat\\nio\\nna\\n\\nl\\n\\nex\\nem\\n\\npl\\nifi\\nes\\n\\ngr\\nou\\n\\np\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne\\nb-\\nd\\n\\nha\\nve\\n\\nad\\nop\\n\\nte\\nd\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nid\\nen\\n\\nti\\nty\\n\\nc\\nol\\nle\\nct\\niv\\ne\\nde\\n\\nfi\\nni\\nti\\non\\n\\nof\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\n(e\\nxe\\nm\\npl\\nar\\n\\nm\\nod\\n\\nel\\n,b\\n\\nut\\nov\\n\\ner\\nti\\nm\\ne\\nit\\nca\\nn\\nbe\\n\\nco\\nm\\ne\\n\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne)\\n\\nh\\nig\\nhe\\n\\nr\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne\\nem\\n\\ner\\nge\\n\\ns\\nfr\\nom\\n\\nlo\\nca\\nl\\n\\n(a\\nb,\\n\\na\\nc\\n,a\\n\\nd\\net\\nc.\\n)\\nre\\nla\\nti\\non\\n\\ns\\n(h\\n\\nop\\nfi\\nel\\nd,\\n\\n19\\n82\\n\\n)\\n\\nc\\non\\n\\nfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nof\\n\\nde\\nni\\nal\\n\\nba\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nsh\\nar\\ned\\n\\n,\\nen\\n\\nac\\nte\\nd\\nun\\n\\nde\\nrs\\nta\\nnd\\n\\nin\\ng\\n\\ng\\nro\\nup\\n\\n(i\\nnt\\ner\\nac\\nti\\non\\n\\ns\\nov\\n\\ner\\nti\\nm\\ne\\n\\ncr\\nea\\nte\\n\\nm\\nes\\no\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne)\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\n\\nenacted processes was the contribution towards the group task (29%;\\nbales, 1958; hollander, 1958; stogdill, 1959). these behaviors are\\nviewed, as a reflection of individuals' conception and future expecta-\\ntions for leadership within a given group (hollander, 1974). the group\\ncontext signals what needs to be considered to deduce appropriate\\nsensegiving behaviors. sensegiving behaviors provide direction and\\nfoster integration that enables group effectiveness (kozlowski, watola,\\njensen, kim, & botero, 2009). stein and heller (1979) stated that “the\\ndevelopment of task leadership roles is the major thesis of emergent\\nleadership theories” (p. 1994). consequently, we argue that the per-\\nformance of these acts is a critical component in the sensegiving process\\nwithin leadership emergence (see table 5). weick's (1979) notion of\\nenacted sensemaking represents this stage of the emergence process.\\n\\nin studying how individual behaviors change over the leadership\\nemergence process, research found that early in the emergence process,\\npeople focus solely on task requirements, whereas later on, they change\\ntheir behaviors based on how the original actions are perceived by\\nothers within the collective (strickland et al., 1978). this supports the\\nclaim that, at an early stage in the emergence process, individuals are\\nperforming actions based on their prior experiences within that context,\\nnot the social confirmation or denial of others. thus, initially the\\namount and type of leadership acts performed by individuals are ex-\\npected to be largely a function of their leadership self-schema. speci-\\nfically, we argue that the probability of a leader behavior by a parti-\\ncular person at one time depends on both leader and follower self-\\nschemas.\\n\\nproposition 3. : the probability that an individual will perform a\\nleadership behavior at a specific time will be based on whether the\\nactivation of their leader self-schema is greater than their follower self-\\nschema at that time.\\n\\nalthough for expositional purposes in propositions 1–3, we re-\\npresent these social processes as not yet developing past the individual\\nlevel, relational and group contexts may be part of the situation that\\nactivates leader or follower schemas. subsequently “reflected-ap-\\npraisal” processes will play a critical role at the relational level of the\\nemergence process (lord & brown, 2004). further, the social processes\\ninvolved in constructing situated identities emerge through a series of\\nactions that play out over time (derue, 2011) and involve resolution of\\nthe ambiguity regarding oneself in a given situation (ashforth &\\nschinoff, 2016). this could be represented by cumulating (more pre-\\ncisely, integrating) propositions 1–3 over a given time period.\\n\\nrelational level\\n\\nself-structure\\n\\nat the relational level, many theories in the literature review de-\\nscribe the emergence process using leaders' adjustment to the ex-\\npectations of followers (39%); additionally, other works focused on the\\nnegotiation of leader-follower identities among members of the collec-\\ntive (derue, 2011; derue & ashford, 2010; marchiondo et al., 2015).\\nin terms of the self, these works describe leadership emergence as the\\nprocess of mutual identity construction occurring across individuals\\nwith differing expectations for leadership. once the emergence process\\nreaches the relational level, the expectation is that individuals have\\nbegun to incorporate social feedback in forming a socially-constructed\\nleader identity; thus, we argue that the formation of a socially em-\\nbedded leader identity serves as evidence that the emergence process\\nhas begun to emphasize the relational level. this is not a discrete\\ntransition, but a gradual shift in emphasis, that merges intra-individual\\nwith inter-individual identity processes.\\n\\nthe critical change that occurs in moving from the individual to the\\nrelational level is that an individual's leader self-identity has an in-\\ncreasingly important social component. for example, in derue and\\nashford's (2010) model of “claiming and granting”, whether an\\n\\nindividual's “claim” of leadership is “granted” by others within a col-\\nlective is critical to determining whether they will maintain a leader\\nidentity. however, there is ambiguity regarding such processes. for\\nexample, whether an individual's actions fit with a leadership prototype\\nis a matter of degree, not an all or nothing process (lord et al., 2001;\\nrosch & lloyd, 1978), and different individuals may hold different\\nleadership prototypes, creating ambiguity in how they interpret and\\nrespond to group activities. by combining these works with works on\\nfollowership self-schemas (lord et al., 1999), we argue that at a deeper\\nlevel, this process of social confirmation is driven by in part by the self-\\nschemas of followers. specifically, if the actions of a leader activate a\\nfollower self-schema in others, then the leader identity of the pro-\\nspective leader is socially confirmed (shondrick & lord, 2010). fur-\\nthermore, other works categorized at the relational level describe the\\nimportant role of followers' implicit leadership theory (ocker, huang,\\nbenbunan-fich, & hiltz, 2011) in the schema activation process. im-\\nportantly, what is occurring over time is the creation of a relation\\namong actors and perceivers that involves the bidirectional effects of\\nidentity activation for both parties to a social exchange. typically, re-\\nlations stabilize by creating an attractor (a double interact) that de-\\npends on the active identities of both parties. this is represented in\\npropositions 4–6, which although developed separately, operate as a\\nsystem that evolves over time.\\n\\nat a basic level, implicit leader theories (ilt) refer to follower\\nprototypes for leaders within a given context (lord, foti, & de vader,\\n1984). according to this work, an individual is more likely to perceive\\nsomeone else as leader if the prospective leader's behaviors coincide\\nwith the follower's expectations for leadership (nye & forsyth, 1991).\\ntaken together, in the process of leadership emergence, we argue that if\\nthere is a match between the characteristics and behaviors of the pro-\\nspective leader and the leadership prototype of perceivers, then they\\nwill apply the category “leader” to the social target depending on the\\ngoodness of fit to their ilt. finally, it is important to note that this\\nprocess is occurring within each dyad, signifying that this dyadic process\\nis occurring across multiple individuals simultaneously within the\\noverall collective. based on this rationale, we represent the extent of\\nleadership perception towards one perspective leader by one perspec-\\ntive follower as the match between the prospective leader's character-\\nistics and the prospective follower's ilt.\\n\\nproposition 4. : leadership perception for a specific individual at a specific\\ntime will be based on the match between the perceiver's ilt and the\\nprospective leader's perceived characteristics.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nhowever, leadership perception is not a passive one-directional\\nprocess. perceiving another as a leader has implications for the per-\\nceiver as well as actor, and it is likely to partially activate a corre-\\nsponding follower's self-schema. the confirmation of the prospective\\nleader's self-identity, ultimately involves the activation of compatible\\nroles that make sense of each party's identity in this situation and give\\nsense to the other party. in other words, underlying a double-interact in\\nterms of surface behaviors related to claiming and granting, is a deeper\\ndouble-interact that reflects the meaning of mutually reinforcing\\nidentities. further, this meaning is discovered by both parties as it is\\nenacted over time. this idea is reflected in sluss and ashforth's (2007)\\ndiscussion of relational identities as encompassing both self-identities\\nand role-based identities (e.g. follower). thus, at the relational level,\\nindividuals begin to act not simply because of self-schemas, but also\\nbased on whether others perceive and respond to them as a leader at\\nthat time.\\n\\nat the relational level, many theories discussed the enactment of\\nleadership emergence through a variation of what weick (1979) re-\\nferred to as double interacts (10%). according to these works (derue,\\n2011; li et al., 2007; marchiondo et al., 2015), interacts occur when the\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n156\\n\\n\\n\\nbehavior of one individual becomes contingent upon the behavior of\\nanother within the system. leadership at its basic nature represents\\ninterpersonal influence (kaiser, hogan, & craig, 2008), and double\\ninteracts are viewed as the “basic unit for describing interpersonal in-\\nfluence” (weick, 1979, p. 89). according to weick (2001), double in-\\nteracts serve as the precursor for collective understandings, because\\nindividuals justify their interactions using the collective as an ex-\\nplanation. for example, within the leadership context, if person a is\\nreflecting on their interactions with person b, they could use the ex-\\nplanation that “person b is a leader within our group, and that is why i\\ninteracted with them in that way”. thus, these interacts help inform\\neach person's understanding of leadership within the collective. alter-\\nnatively, individuals may not think explicitly about such roles, but ra-\\nther respond implicitly as leader and follower identities are constructed\\nover time through enactive processes.\\n\\nwhether constructed implicitly or explicitly, affectively or cogni-\\ntively, identities developed through double interacts reflect attractors\\nthat make sense of the past and can guide future interacts. thereby a\\npatterning of leader-follower interactions takes place (derue, 2011).\\naccording to shondrick and lord (2010), the social construction of\\nleadership occurs when (1) a potential leader perceives or infers a\\ngroup of individuals to be his or her followers and when (2) individuals\\nin a group begin to view themselves as being led by that prospective\\nleader. it is through these interacts that individuals begin to rely on\\nboth active self-schemas, situated provisional identities, as well as the\\nperceptions and reactions of others. thus, as previously argued, at the\\nrelational stage individuals begin to transition from leader and follower\\nself-schemas, to leader and follower identities, as their self-schemas\\nbecome socially confirmed through the double interacts.\\n\\nspecifically, at the dyadic level, the probability that a single person\\nwill have a leadership identity will be a function of their activation of\\nleadership self-schema, in addition to the leadership perception of a\\nprospective follower. furthermore, the probability that a person will\\nactivate a follower identity will be a function of their followership self-\\nschema in addition to whether they perceive the other person as a\\nleader. finally, as self-schema activation incorporates self-perceptions\\nwithin that given domain (markus & wurf, 1987), we represent the\\nprobability of activating leader and follower identities in propositions 5\\nand 6, respectively. it is important to note that proposition 5 includes a\\ncomponent pertaining to leaders and another pertaining to followers,\\nthus reflecting the mutual dependence in a double interact. proposition\\n6 reflects self-schema activation by the prospective follower as well as\\ntheir perceptions of their dyadic partner, which is an internal re-\\npresentation of a double interact held by this prospective follower.\\ntogether, propositions 5 and 6 are defined at a level that integrates\\none's self-identity with both the activation of internal knowledge\\nstructures, that is, self-schemas, and the leadership perception process.\\n\\nproposition 5. the probability that a leader identity is activated for a\\nperson depends on that person's activation of their leadership self-schema\\nand their dyadic partner's leadership perception of them at that time.\\n\\nproposition 6. the probability that a follower identity is activated for a\\nperson depends on that person's activation of their followership self-schema\\nand their perception that their dyadic partner is a leader at that time.\\n\\nthese interacts represent the micro elements of the process by\\nwhich leaders and followers negotiate their individualized internal re-\\npresentations of leadership (i.e. leadership self-structures). these ele-\\nments are not static, but as the indexing by time implies, they evolve\\nover time, as do leadership perceptions (see proposition 4). it is im-\\nportant to recognize that follower self-schemas have many positive\\nattributes such as being productive, going above and beyond, and being\\na team player (sy, 2010) that may be part of leadership processes as\\nwell. though one initially may have been guided by a follower schema,\\nindividuals who excel on these factors may be perceived by others as\\nexhibiting leadership, and communication of these social perceptions\\n\\nmay be part of the process that activates one's leadership schemas. in\\nother words, leadership may at times be recognized by others before\\nbeing recognized in oneself (alvesson & sveningsson, 2003; paunova,\\n2015).\\n\\nthis mutual form of enactment can be further represented by the\\nphenomenon of synchronization, which is a fundamental component to\\ndynamical systems (blasius, huppert, & stone, 1999). synchronization\\nrepresents the process by which two separate systems coupled within\\nthe same environment demonstrate identical or compatible dynamics\\nover time (rulkov, sushchik, tsimring, & abarbanel, 1995). a classic\\nexample of synchronization is the fact that metronomes operating at\\ndifferent tempos will synchronize to the same tempo when placed on a\\ncommon base (pantaleone, 2002). jiang et al. (2015) found that leader-\\nfollower relationships were characterized by neural synchronization\\nthat occurred over time. specifically, they measured the communica-\\ntion frequency and neural synchronization of groups performing a\\nleaderless group problem solving task and found that quality of com-\\nmunication predicted neural synchronization in emergent leader-fol-\\nlower relationships. this is critical, as during the process of sense-\\nmaking, double interacts enable individuals to develop shared\\nunderstandings of the social environment (weick, 2001). thus, we\\nargue that these leader-follower interactions form synchrony in beha-\\nvior over time, which begins to manifest as stable leader-follower re-\\nlationships that are grounded in situated identities, as well as the for-\\nmation of shared internal representations of leadership within the\\ncollective (self-structure).\\n\\nat this point in the emergence process, leadership may not have\\nfully emerged, as these double interacts may not developed into a stable\\npattern of interactions. weick (1979) argues that these interacts cannot\\nbe viewed as stable until both (1) the leaders actions become pre-\\ndictable and (2) the followers subsequent actions become predictable\\n(weick, 1979). in other words, the perceptions of both the leader and\\nfollower cross thresholds and both individuals become mutually inter-\\ndependent. we believe that once these two requirements are met,\\nleader and follower identities begin to solidify, and stable leader-fol-\\nlower relationships are formed. over time, we represent the relational\\nprocesses of leadership emergence as individuals performing actions as\\na function of their self-schema (proposition 3), as well as if past acts\\nhave been confirmed, which we argue is a direct function of the lea-\\ndership perceptions of prospective followers. therefore, through this\\nconfirmation process (driven by leadership perceptions and self-schema\\nactivation) stable leader and follower identities begin to form as role-\\nbased attractors in a dynamic, dyadic system and these attractors guide\\nsubsequent dyadic social interactions. but the interactions reflect only a\\nsurface structure that is supported by the deeper emergences of syn-\\nchronized identities as specified in propositions 4–6. we should stress\\nthat for expositional convenience, we have depicted these micro ele-\\nments of structure at the relational level as being independent of the\\ncollective level. we relax that assumption as we discuss leadership and\\nidentity structures at the collective level.\\n\\ncollective level\\n\\nself-structure\\n\\none of the common collective process mechanism found in papers\\nfrom our literature review was social identification (13%). most of\\nthese papers specifically included the “social identity theory of lea-\\ndership” (hogg, 2001). this theory builds from the relational level by\\ndescribing how individuals begin to view leadership in terms of specific\\ngroup prototypes, rather than their individualized leader prototypes\\n(reicher, haslam, & hopkins, 2005). at this point in the emergence\\nprocess, for one individual to emerge as a group leader, it is not enough\\nfor their behavior to activate follower self-schemas in others; in addi-\\ntion, emergence begins to occur once a prospective leader's actions fit to\\nthe group's leadership prototype (van knippenberg, van knippenberg,\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n157\\n\\n\\n\\nde cremer, & hogg, 2004). accordingly, at the collective level, once a\\npatterning of interactions results in followers contextualizing their\\nfollower schemas into a stable follower identity, this advances the\\nemergence process. furthermore, if all followers develop a follower\\nidentity in the context of a single prospective leader's actions, then that\\nindividual is likely to be exemplifying the leadership group prototype,\\nthe shared cognitive representation that the collective has for leader-\\nship (reicher et al., 2005).\\n\\nat the collective level, the process of social identification represents\\nthe critical “identity work” that underlies the emergence process.\\naccording to van knippenberg (2011), social identification represents\\nthe process by which the interests of the group become central to each\\nindividual's self-identity. thus, over the emergence process, through\\nsocial identification, individuals are expected to shift from viewing\\nleadership through their leadership self-schemas to viewing leadership\\nthrough the lens of their group. this process may be gradual and au-\\ntomatic as connectionist systems that support categorization processes\\nincorporate the group context into contextualized implicit leadership\\ntheories (lord, brown, & harvey, 2001). the primary motivational\\ndriver of this process is uncertainty reduction (hogg, 2007). according\\nto this perspective, viewing leadership differently than others within\\nthe collective creates uncertainty about the future. as individuals seek\\nto predict and control their social world (leotti, iyengar, & ochsner,\\n2010), this uncertainty leads to internal tensions which provokes an-\\nxiety and stress (hogg, 2001). thus, to reduce the negative effects of\\nuncertainty, individuals incorporate to a collective understanding of\\nleadership.\\n\\nas each group member begins to identify with the collective level,\\ntheir potential leader and follower identity becomes a function of both\\ntheir leader and follower dyadic self-identities, as well as the collective\\nleadership perceptions of others within the group. that is, the prob-\\nability that they will have a leader identity at the collective level be-\\ncomes a function of both their leader self-identities, as well as the\\ncollective leadership perceptions that others in the group have of them.\\nadditionally, the probability that an individual will activate a follower\\nidentity will be a function of their follower self-schema, as well as\\nwhether they—and others—perceive someone else as a perspective\\nleader at that time. we represent this process in propositions 7 and 8\\nwhich include an aggregation across group members of the dyadic level\\nleadership perceptions, to reflect the collective leadership identity of\\none person at a specific time point.\\n\\nproposition 7. at the collective level, the probability that a person's leader\\nidentity is activated depends on both their individual leadership self-schema\\nactivation, as well as the leadership perceptions of others towards them.\\n\\nproposition 8. at the collective level, the probability that a person's\\nfollower identity is activated depends on both their individual followership\\nself-schema activation, as well as the followership perceptions of others\\ntowards them.\\n\\npropositions 7 and 8 represent an independent aggregation across\\ndyads, or what has been labeled compositional aggregation (dinh et al.,\\n2014; kozlowski & klein, 2000; lord, hannah, & jennings, 2011). if,\\nhowever, the processes underlying dyadic identity formation interact\\nand form a new construct at the collective level, which in the next\\nparagraph we maintain is likely, then collective leadership identities\\nshould be qualitatively different than dyadic leader identities, a process\\nthat would be termed compilational aggregation. compilational ag-\\ngregation would also require adding a component which reflects the\\ninterdependence of dyadic processes, which is addressed in the fol-\\nlowing section on enacted structures.\\n\\nin connecting the individual-level schemas to the formation of col-\\nlective identities, social identification represents a meso process\\nwhereby individuals transition from external categorization to internal\\nidentification. according to social identity theory (tajfel & turner,\\n1986), social categorization is externally-oriented as it concerns others,\\n\\nand social identification is internally-oriented as it concerns the self\\n(jenkins, 2000). we argue that this distinction is critical to under-\\nstanding the process of leadership emergence because the interpreta-\\ntion of leadership changes orientations as the process crosses levels.\\nspecifically, at the lower levels, individuals view their interactions with\\nothers within the collective as external to their self-concept. however, if\\nthe process of social identification occurs, each person is expected to\\nthink about these collective interactions internally—in reference to\\nthemselves. we argue that the shift from external categorization to\\ninternal categorization begins to capture when leadership has emerged\\n(i.e. collective structure has formed). further, when an emergent leader\\nidentifies with a group and embodies the group prototype, her or his\\nown self-schema becomes more consistent with the group level cogni-\\ntive structure.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nat the collective level, other common process mechanisms were the\\ncollective patterning of interaction (26%), and tension reduction (22%).\\nfurthermore, these mechanisms were primarily discussed in papers that\\nused complexity perspectives (e.g. lichtenstein et al., 2006; uhl-bien\\net al., 2007). according to these works, the emergence process is re-\\npresented by a patterning of leader-follower interactions over time.\\nhowever, complexity approaches go beyond leader-follower interac-\\ntions by discussing the collective mechanisms that operate at the group\\nlevel to drive the emergence process. the major mechanism at the\\ngroup level is the idea of tension reduction, in that the patterns of\\nleader-follower interactions serve to adaptively reduce tension and ul-\\ntimately reach collective goals (hazy, 2008). this reflects the idea of\\ncollective identity, as individuals seek to resolve the internal tension of\\nuncertainty experienced when competing conceptions of leadership\\noccur (hogg, 2001, 2007).\\n\\nin addition to the internal tension of uncertainty, the tension caused\\nby having to adapt to the external environment can be viewed as the\\nprimary external tension within the leadership emergence process\\n(schneider & somers, 2006). to illustrate how both these internal and\\nexternal tensions drive the leadership emergence process, we pair\\ncomplexity theory with two other non-linear dynamical systems: neural\\nnetworks (hopfield, 1984) and spin glass structures (stein & newman,\\n2013). according to theory on hopfield networks, over time a collective\\nof neurons explore different patterns of activation to reach the\\nminimum amount of energy required to produce an outcome (hopfield,\\n1984). regarding the emergence process, we argue that this represents\\nthe external tensions, as a collective must perform a specific pattern of\\nleader-follower interactions to meet the environmental requirements.\\nconsequently, we argue that over time, a collective will enact specific\\npatterns of double interacts between leaders and followers until the\\nmost efficient pattern is found.\\n\\nto extend the idea of neural networks to the internal tensions that\\ndrive leadership emergence, it helps to incorporate the concept of spin\\nglass structures, a common phenomenon used in complexity theory\\n(stein & newman, 2013). spin glasses are disordered magnetic mate-\\nrials which contain elements of polarity (i.e. positive or negative state).\\nthrough local interaction of each unit with adjacent units, the specific\\natoms within the structure move from disorder to a coherent global\\npattern. thus, the structure resolves the internal tension caused by\\ndisequilibrium across atoms by moving to a global state of equilibrium.\\nnot only is this transition to equilibrium fundamental in spin glass\\nstructures, but this is a central tenet to complexity leadership per-\\nspectives (schneider & somers, 2006). accordingly, we argue that just\\nas individual atoms within a spin glass structure change positions to\\nalign with the other atoms in the structure (or in terms we have de-\\nveloped create double interacts), through a series of interacts (weick,\\n1979), dyads shift their structure to align with other dyads in the col-\\nlective. for example, in a group of four people (a, b, c, d), if a and b\\nare in a leader-follower relationship, c will be more likely to develop a\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\n\\nfollower relationship to a. that is, the a-b double interact tends to\\n“flip” the a-c double interact; as this happens throughout a group, a\\nstable leadership structure emerges. furthermore, this alignment to the\\ncollective reduces the internal tensions driven by uncertainty (hogg,\\n2001).\\n\\nto reflect this between-dyad interaction, we would modify\\nproposition 4, which involves the match of leader characteristics to\\nfollower's ilt, to form proposition 9 which takes into account this\\ngroup context by introducing a bias component that reflects this effect\\nof other dyadic relations in a group. we assume that the biases invol-\\nving different pairs of dyads are encountered over time as attention\\nshifts from one dyadic comparison to another.\\n\\nproposition 9. the collective leadership perception towards one individual\\nin a group at one time depends on the match of the prospective leader's\\ncharacteristics to each group member's ilt's, as well as the additional biasing\\neffect of the other dyadic leadership relations in the group.\\n\\nproposition 9 thus translates the dyadic process into a group context\\nand reflects what klein, dansereau, and hall (1994) have termed a\\nparts within wholes relationship. we are arguing then that the group\\ncontext changes how dyadic leadership perceptions function through\\nthis biasing function that operates sequentially as a particular dyad ac\\nis compared to other dyads ab or ad. over time this comparison can\\nintroduce variability into how a is perceived by c, but eventually this\\nvariability will be reduced as a more uniform structure evolves and\\nthere are shared perceptions of person a by group members b, c, and d.\\nat this point a group-level attractor exists, and the biasing function\\nbecomes uniform across possible pairs of dyads, reflecting the evolved\\ncommon understanding or group context. in other words, group as well\\nas dyadic identities are activated. importantly, the bias created by the\\ngroup context also changes the meaning of propositions 5–8, which\\nnow are based on a leadership perception process involving group as\\nwell as dyadic properties. therefore, when leadership emerges to a\\ncollective phenomenon, the bias operates at each dyadic level, as a\\nfunction of the solidified collective outcome.\\n\\nfinally, to fully represent how the leadership emergence process\\noccurs over time, it is crucial to incorporate the idea of entropy in\\ndynamical systems. according to general systems theory, entropy re-\\npresents the degree of disorder within a dynamic system (skyttner,\\n2005). within the realm of psychology, hirsh et al. (2012) describe\\nentropy as great uncertainty about “which state currently defines a\\nsystem” (p. 305). we argue that this accurately represents the process of\\nleadership emergence where high entropy would occur in a system\\nwhere individuals did not differentiate between who they expected to\\nperform a leadership role at a given moment, and the leadership per-\\nceptions of one person towards each member of the group would be\\nrelatively equal across all individuals; that is for all group members as\\nperceived by that one individual.\\n\\nentropy will increase in proportion to the number of competing\\npossibilities that must be selected from. low entropy levels are re-\\npresented by tight distributions, where one outcome is much more\\nprobable to occur compared to other outcomes, whereas high entropy\\nlevels are represented by flat probability distributions where any out-\\ncome is close in likelihood for all outcomes (hirsh et al., 2012). we\\nrepresent entropy in terms of collective leadership identities to capture\\na schematic understanding that reflects the combined individual,\\ndyadic, and collective levels; and we use identity rather than behavior\\nor self-schema to represent a deeper, contextualized understanding of\\nthe self rather than moment to moment variation in surface-level, task-\\nrelated behaviors.\\n\\nthe relative entropy is a function of the relative probability each\\nindividual will activate a leader identity at a certain time. if many in-\\ndividuals have a high probability of leadership identity activation, the\\ncollective will have high levels of leadership entropy (see fig. 2 for\\nillustration). this represents the level of entropy within a collective at\\none point in time. thus, a critical component of non-linear dynamical\\n\\nsystems is that they are expected to shift in levels of entropy over time\\n(prigogine, 1978). furthermore, these changes in entropy represent\\nimportant structural changes for emergent properties (hirsh et al.,\\n2012). regarding the leadership emergence process, if the collective\\nhas low entropy at a particular time, this would mean that there was a\\nclear collective understanding of who is the leader within that specific\\nevent. however, if over time, the members of the collective begin to\\nrealize that this individual was not fulfilling group objectives (external\\ntension), this may cause members to experiment with new leadership\\nroles. if this occurred, the level of both uncertainty and entropy would\\nincrease within the collective. however, if the collective then finds a\\nnew structure of leadership that can resolve these external tensions,\\nthey will adopt this new attractor state with perhaps different persons\\nidentifying as the group leaders; thus, entropy levels will decrease once\\nthis new attractor state is reached.\\n\\nfinally, this theorizing about the collective changes in leadership\\nover time aligns closely with the review findings regarding principle 3.\\nspecifically, in reviewing previous works that theorize or test the post-\\nemergent dynamics of leadership, works focused at the collective level\\ndescribed important changes occurring over time in the collective lea-\\ndership structure. as illustrated in table 3, while early works studying\\nthe nomination of individuals has found that leadership can demonstrate\\nstability over time if the task environment does not change, works on\\nteams and networks has found that the collective continues to de-\\nmonstrate significant changes in the leadership structure (klein,\\nziegert, knight, & xiao, 2006). furthermore, as these changes are a\\nfunction of multiple dynamic inputs, the form of change is expected to\\nbe non-linear, with different elements affecting the collective structure\\nat different points in the groups life cycle (uhl-bien et al., 2007).\\n\\nto summarize, we argue that leadership emergence is represented\\nby a dynamic multi-level process, starting with deep structure elements\\nof self-schema activation and translating into contextualized identities\\nas function of social feedback. the fundamental mechanism is a double-\\ninteract in which each party both perceives the other and activates a\\nself-identity that is consistent with this perception, and when these\\nprocesses align over the group, entropy is low and a stable group-level\\nattractor also exists. this collective leadership structure continues to\\nadapt to a dynamic environment. however, the emergent structure is\\nformed by the interaction of each individual's deep-level social cogni-\\ntive processes, which drive the sensegiving and sensemaking mechan-\\nisms of leadership emergence.\\n\\nin developing this conceptual framework describing the leadership\\nemergence process, we believe that we have made six primary con-\\ntributions. first, this framework captures how the emergence process\\ncan develop at individual, dyadic, and group levels, either sequentially\\nor simultaneously. second, we have specified key variables based on an\\nextensive and careful review of the literature that capture both deep\\nand surface level structures. third, we have translated processes into\\npropositions which can guide future empirical estimation and reflect\\nthe dynamics of leadership structure emergence on both an in-\\ntrapersonal and interpersonal basis. fourth, the overall framework is\\nindexed by time to reflect its dynamic nature and facilitate future works\\nwhich aim to incorporate a temporal component that address changes\\nover time. fifth, we have focused on the link between leadership and\\nidentity because identity is a powerful schema that guides behavior,\\nskill acquisition, motivation, and social perceptions. in other terms, we\\nhave taken a deep-structure approach to understanding dynamic\\nemergent processes. this provides an important complement to the\\nprevious works that have approached emergence from a multilevel\\nperspective, while focusing on the interactions among individuals\\nwhich reflect the deep level processes our framework introduces (e.g.\\nderue, 2011). finally, we have also grounded the process in theories of\\nleadership perception at an individual level and uncertainty or entropy\\nat the group level (i.e. bridging levels). together these six contributions\\nadvance our understanding of leadership emergence and provide a basis\\nto further develop process approaches.\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n159\\n\\n\\n\\navenues for future research\\n\\nin the previous sections, we reviewed the extant literature and de-\\nveloped a framework to articulate the basic elemental content of what\\nis exchanged and the process mechanisms describing how it is ex-\\nchanged, resulting in the emergence of leadership. as noted by\\nkozlowski (2015), this type of emergent framework delves into the\\ndeep details, where leadership emergence is not a “box” in a model\\n(kozlowski & chao, 2012). rather, “it is a specification of the actual\\npsychological and/or behavioral action at the lowest level of analysis\\nthat contribute to the emergence of the phenomenon” (p. 16). as our\\nframework focuses on delineating the underlying mechanisms of the\\nleadership emergence process, we propose that future research imple-\\nment two types of computational modeling to further develop and ul-\\ntimately test our framework: agent-based modeling (abm) and equa-\\ntion-based modeling (ebm). however, it is important to establish that\\nour process oriented framework represents narrative theory that can\\nonly be used to assist in the larger process of formulating a computa-\\ntional model; it is not intended to be directly translated into either type\\nof computation modeling. therefore, in explaining the unique benefits\\nof both abm and ebm (parunak, savit, & riolo, 1998) we note where\\nthe current paper leaves off, and where future work would serve to\\ncontinue the development of modeling tools which study the leadership\\nemergence process.\\n\\nas abm can be used to test the rules that lower level “agents” (e.g.\\npersons) follow when forming a higher-level unit (bonabeau, 2002), we\\nargue that it can be used to simulate the enacted processes of our fra-\\nmework in a dynamic fashion. castillo and trinh (2018) provide a\\ndetailed explication of the benefits and uses of abm to study leadership.\\nin order to develop an abm of the leadership emergence process, spe-\\ncific assumptions would have to be stipulated regarding the rules that\\nagents follow within the system. the current paper represents what\\nkozlowski et al. (2013) and grand et al. (2016) would describe as step\\n1 of a larger process, which they define as “a narrative theory of what\\nindividuals do, think, feel, that gives rise to a higher level outcome.”\\n(grand et al., 2016, p. 1354). accordingly, to develop an associated\\nagent based model, this process requires the next step of translating this\\nnarrative theory into a series of if-then statements which outline how\\neach agent would behave within the overall system. for example, in\\nfollowing the model developed in grand et al. (2016), our current\\nframework would likely be separated into two categories of statements:\\none related to leader/follower actions, and one related to leader/fol-\\nlower perceptions. subsequently, individual statements could be in-\\ntroduced such as: if an agent's leader self-schema is greater than their\\nfollower self-schema, then they perform a leadership behavior. finally, it is\\nnecessary to include a series of group-level statements, which stipulate\\nthe process by which the group reaches consensus (i.e. leadership has\\nemerged), and the simulation ends.\\n\\nadditionally, as ebm has been effectively used to simulate the\\ncomplex intra-individual motivational and self-related processes within\\norganizational phenomena (vancouver & weinhardt, 2010; vancouver\\n& weinhardt, 2012), we argue that ebm can be uniquely used to si-\\nmulate the deep-level mechanisms driving the surface level interactions\\nto which our framework emphasizes. specifically, vancouver and\\n\\nweinhardt (2012) argue that ebm—using a system dynamics per-\\nspective—is a preferred method for testing phenomena at the “intra-\\nagent” level, which is a level that our framework specifically targets\\n(i.e. cognitive processes). however, in the previous works that im-\\nplemented these types for modeling procedures, it is critical to note the\\ncurrent paper is not sufficient to develop this type of model. instead,\\nebm requires the development of formal mathematical expressions\\nwhich are used to represent the system of interest. unlike the protocol\\nfor developing an abm simulation, the ebm protocol using a system\\ndynamics perspective would involve first defining the key variables in\\nthe system, then specifying the mathematical relations among these\\nvariables (vancouver & weinhardt, 2012). it should also be noted that\\nfor both abm and ebm, the appropriate temporal frame would have to\\nbe defined in order for the model to be performed. as the current fra-\\nmework provides single level propositions which define the critical\\nvariables in the leadership emergence system, it may align more closely\\nwith the development of an ebm model using a system dynamics per-\\nspective. however, we formed the propositions such that future works\\ncould use the current paper for the development of formal models\\nwhich then could be adapted to either form of computational modeling.\\nin doing so, we believe that abm and ebm can offer unique and com-\\nplementary benefits for studying both the deep-level and surface-level\\ncomponents in our overall leadership emergence framework.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nin this article, we developed a framework that emphasizes the im-\\nportance of a multilevel process to understand leadership emergence.\\nalthough the framework's underlying structure was designed to include\\nthe most fundamental processes of leadership emergence, we view our\\nframework as a starting point for future research to continue unpacking\\nthe dynamics of leadership emergence. as our mapping process cannot\\nempirically evaluate the underlying process mechanisms in leadership\\nemergence, we hope that future works can build off our framework by\\nstatistically evaluating the relative importance of process mechanisms\\nusing techniques such as computational modeling (poile & safayeni,\\n2016). in addition, by focusing our literature search on psychology and\\nmanagement areas, we may have excluded theory and research on\\nemergent leadership in other domains such as education.\\n\\nfinally, it's important to note that in our process-oriented frame-\\nwork, we did not incorporate the full dynamic nature of context.\\nspecifically, it is well established that the bottom-up processes of\\nemergence and the top-down processes of context are related in a dy-\\nnamic and reciprocal fashion (kozlowski, chao, grand, braun, &\\nkuljanin, 2016). furthermore, the leadership emergence process is now\\nunderstood to be embedded within greater social networks (carter\\net al., 2015). for example, leadership is both embedded with informal\\nsocial networks (e.g. advice networks), as well as formal hierarchical\\norganizational structures (e.g. formal leaders). the current paper did\\nnot intend to address these exogenous contextual effects, but rather to\\naddress carter and colleagues' call for “research that identifies the en-\\ndogenous rules or principles governing leadership emergence” (carter\\net al., 2015, p. 614). finally, although contextual effects are not directly\\nincorporated into our framework, top-down constraints are indirectly\\n\\nfig. 2. illustration of differing levels of leadership entropy in the collective leadership identity (li) activation process.\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n160\\n\\n\\n\\nreflected by the incorporation of contextual adjustments in leadership\\nprototypes (foti et al., 2008; lord et al., 2001; sy et al., 2010).\\n\\nconclusions\\n\\nour review shows the diversity of approaches in the area of lea-\\ndership emergence. although this diversity has brought forth novel\\nperspectives that enrich our knowledge of leadership emergence, it also\\npresents several challenges that future research must address. notably,\\nin our framework, we have incorporated and integrated process me-\\nchanisms from the micro-level perspectives (cf., self-schema and iden-\\ntity) to the macro level (cf., complexity theory). we have argued that\\nattention to these dynamic processes as they unfold over time and\\nacross different levels of analysis is critical because it helps capture the\\ncomplexity that defines real individual, group, and organizational sys-\\ntems. therefore, efforts to advance leadership theory and research will\\nrequire that we pay attention to the processes that underlie these\\nphenomena as they occur at multiple levels of analysis. these levels\\nexist both across social units and within individuals as we move from\\nsurface structures emphasizing behaviors to underlying identity struc-\\ntures. by developing a framework that focuses on the process of lea-\\ndership emergence involving both leadership and identities, we help\\nbridge a disconnect between leadership emergence and its associated\\nprocesses (dinh et al., 2014), thus paving the way for a major ad-\\nvancement within the field of leadership.\\n\\nwe close with a quote from hunt and dodge (2000) who wrote, “to\\nknow where we are going with leadership research, we must know\\nwhere we are, and where we have been—we must look backward and\\nforward at the same time” (p. 453). as has been noted multiple times in\\nthe past, the idea of informal leadership processes being distinct from\\ntheir associated outcomes is not a new idea. nevertheless, as our review\\nindicated, it seems that the field has largely forgotten about the pro-\\ngress made 60 years ago in the study of leadership processes. emer-\\ngence theory describes processes that are dynamic, integrating re-\\nlationship across all moments in time. in other words, the past\\ninfluences the future and the future influences the past. we hope that\\nour review, highlights this progress and creates a basis for further ad-\\nvancement.\\n\\nacknowledgments\\n\\nwe would like to thank the anonymous reviewer and david day for\\ntheir valuable comments and suggestions that improved the quality of\\nthe paper. we also thank erika hernandez for her comments on an\\nearlier version of this article.\\n\""

zaccaro, rittman, & marks, 2001) and relational lea-\\ndership (uhl-bien, 2006). consistent with the growing emphasis on\\nshort-lived, self-managed groups in which leadership is not ascribed but\\nrather emerges informally (morgeson et al., 2010), we focus on lea-\\ndership emergence – the process by which individuals become influential\\nin the perceptions of others (lord & maher, 1990; schneider & goktepe,\\n1983; taggar, hackett, & saha, 1999). understanding the fine-grained\\ncognitive and social dynamics by which leaders emerge in informal\\ngroup settings is an important piece of the leadership puzzle that can\\n\\noffer us unique insights into the drivers of leader and follower cogni-\\ntions and actions.\\n\\nin the traditional leadership emergence research paradigm, “group\\nparticipants might be measured on a number of traits that could pos-\\nsibly be related to leadership behaviors. members of the group then\\ninteract while carrying out a task. then magic happens and a leader\\nemerges from the group at the end of the discussion period” (guastello,\\n2007, p. 357). thus, leadership emergence is an outcome of an un-\\nmeasured magical process, which we hope to demystify. moreover, this\\nleader-focused perspective does not follow from the current view of\\nleadership as a mutual social influence process. leadership emergence\\ndoes not reside in a person but rather in an interactive dynamic, within\\nwhich any particular person will participate as a leader or a follower at\\ndifferent times and for different purposes. accordingly, we advance the\\nstudy of leadership emergence by conceptualizing emergence from a\\nmultilevel theory and complexity science perspective (kozlowski &\\nklein, 2000; lichtenstein & plowman, 2009; morgeson & hofmann,\\n1999; sawyer, 2001) for the purposes of developing a process oriented\\nperspective of leadership emergence. in a process perspective, the space\\nbetween individuals (uhl-bien & ospina, 2012), developments over\\ntime (day & thornton, 2018), double interacts (derue, 2011), and\\naggregation to group levels (dinh et al., 2014) are as important as the\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.002\\nreceived 20 january 2017;

(2013), “the\\nextent that emergence is shown any attention at all in such research, it\\nis indirect with respect to models of measurement and data aggregation\\nfor representing higher order constructs” (p. 600). by developing an\\nintegrative framework of leadership emergence, we specify the under-\\nlying theoretical rationale for how the elements at the lower level in-\\nteract to create a social structure at the higher level. moreover, we\\ndepict social structure as not just existing at a surface level in terms of\\nfunctional behaviors of leaders, but in terms of deeper constructs such\\nas roles and identities as they develop over time.\\n\\nthe remainder of our review has four sections. first, to organize the\\nreview we conceptualize the leadership emergence process from a\\ncomplexity perspective and define emergence as a dynamic, interactive\\nprocess. in doing so, we introduce three principles of emergent phe-\\nnomena which are derived from previous works on multilevel theory\\n(klein & kozlowski, 2000; kozlowski & klein, 2000; kozlowski et al.,\\n2013). second, we review how previous research has modeled leader-\\nship emergence by focusing on the content areas of the lower-level\\nelements, the mechanisms that facilitate their emergence, and the dy-\\nnamism of the process once it has emerged. third, based on the findings\\nfrom the review, we develop a process-oriented framework of leader-\\nship emergence that builds on prior work (e.g., derue, 2011) and ex-\\ntends it to a deeper level. fourth, we offer suggestions to guide devel-\\noping and testing emergent leadership processes, and we conclude with\\nrecommendations for future leadership process research.\\n\\nemergence theory\\n\\nthe relationship between the individual and the collective is a\\nfundamental one. the notion of emergence has a long history with roots\\nin the philosophy of science, biology, physics, sociology, and more re-\\ncently, it has been integrated with complexity theory (see sawyer, 2001\\nand kozlowski et al., 2013 for reviews). new research on chaos\\n(guastello, 2007), self-organization (vallacher, van geert, & nowak,\\n2015), adaptive systems (grossberg, 2013), nonlinear dynamics\\n(newell & molenar, 2014), and artificial life (olson, knoester, & adami,\\n2016) are all part of this growing interest in complex systems. the in-\\nterest has spread from the scientific community to popular culture, with\\nthe publication of general interest books about research into complex\\nsystems (holland, 1995, 1998).\\n\\naccording to the philosopher david blitz (1992), the term ‘emer-\\ngent’ was coined by the pioneer psychologist g. h. lewes (1874a,\\n1874b). emergence is one of the most ubiquitous processes, and yet one\\nof the least understood. this has resulted in many different perspectives\\nand definitions of emergence. recently, goldstein (1999, 2000) iden-\\ntified six properties of emergent phenomena across disciplines: quali-\\ntative novelty (features not previously observed at the micro level),\\ncoherence (integrated wholes that maintain identity over time), global/\\nmacro level (locus of the phenomena at a higher level), dynamic (new\\nattractors arise over time), ostensive (recognizable phenomena), and\\nsupervenience (the asymmetrical relation between two levels). in\\ncomplex systems, self-organization is the process through which order\\nin the form of new structures arises from disorder and entropy at lower\\nlevels. according to hirsh, mar, and peterson (2012), if the environ-\\nment changes to produce greater entropy for a system thus challenging\\nits structural coherence, then that system must adopt new patterns of\\nself-organization that are capable of accommodating the environmental\\nchanges. emergent phenomena are the self-generated novel structures\\nthat confer adaptability to complex systems. thus, from an emergence\\nperspective, we define leadership emergence as the multilevel interac-\\ntional process driven by deep level cognitive and perceptual processes of\\ngroup members that form a collective patterning of leader and follower in-\\nteractions over time.\\n\\nin the area of social emergence, sawyer (2001) contrasts two\\nemergence paradigms, similar to bedau's (1997) notion of strong vs.\\nweak emergence. the first paradigm is collective emergence, which\\nholds that group behavior is constituted by individual action, yet\\ncannot be reduced to the individual level. this holistic view of emer-\\ngence argues that emergent phenomena result in qualitative changes\\nthat are different from, and irreducible to, their parts. this con-\\nceptualization is consistent with emergence principles in philosophy\\n(epstein, 1999), sociology (durkheim, 1895; durkheim, 1964), and\\nphysics (anderson, 1972), as well general systems theory (von\\nbertalanffy, 1956; von bertalanffy, 1968).\\n\\nthe second paradigm is individualist emergence, which accepts the\\nexistence of emergent phenomena; however, the emergent outcome can\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n146\\n\\n\\n\\nalways be reduced to individuals and their relationships (russell,\\n1927). this conceptualization is consistent with how social properties\\nemerge from individual action (axelrod, 1997; homans, 1958). classic\\nexamples of this second conceptualization of emergence include traffic\\njams (wilensky & resnick, 1999) and bird flocks (reynolds, 1987). for\\nexample, the bird flock emerges out of three simple interaction rules\\nfollowed by individual birds: (1) avoid collisions, (2) match speeds with\\nyour neighbors, and (3) move towards the center of mass of your\\nneighbors. no central director or leader is needed. the flocking is\\nemergent because it is not caused by any one bird but by all the birds\\ninteracting together; the formation in the flocking is made up of all the\\nbirds but “transcends” them as well. both conceptualizations of emer-\\ngence agree on the importance of analyzing processes of emergence\\nthrough time. importantly, corning (2012) reconciles these two posi-\\ntions by positing that reductionism, or detailed analysis of the parts and\\ntheir interactions, is essential for answering the “how” question;\\nwhereas, holism is equally necessary for answering the “why” question.\\nin order to answer the “why” question, a broader, multileveled para-\\ndigm is required.\\n\\nthus, the notion of levels is central to understanding the emergent\\nphenomena. as noted by kozlowski et al. (2013), “the goal is to un-\\nderstand the process of emergence through system dynamics across\\nmultiple levels – simultaneously” (p. 585). similarly, leadership re-\\nsearch highlights the multilevel nature of the construct (derue, 2011;\\nlord & dinh, 2014). we use wiley's (1988) notion of four levels of\\nsubjectivity to bridge the micro to the macro level and to deduce the\\nprocess mechanisms inherent in micro-level dynamics that yield the\\nhigher level phenomenon. wiley's four levels of subjectivity allow a\\nbetter understanding and appreciation of the fundamentally interactive\\nnature of leadership emergence through an emphasis on the importance\\nof interaction, structure, and context. the different levels discussed by\\nwiley are: (1) intrasubjective (individual), (2) intersubjective (inter-\\nactive), (3) generic subjective (social) and (4) extrasubjective (macro-\\nculture).\\n\\nthe first level, intrasubjective, is concerned with the constantly\\nemerging nature of the self. at this level, characteristics of the in-\\ndividual are expected to vary systematically within person, across\\nevents, or over time, as in the development of a leadership identity. the\\nnext level – intersubjective level is primarily one of interaction and\\nconcerns the relation and impact of one individual to another. of all the\\nlevels involved in leadership, the one arguably most in need of ad-\\nvancement is the dyad, which according to yammarino and gooty\\n(2017), is “the most neglected and poorly understood level of analysis\\nin leadership research” (p. 229). the intersubjective level moves be-\\nyond any single individual and is “emergent upon the interchange and\\nsynthesis of two, or more, communicating selves” (wiley, 1988, p. 258).\\nat this level, the process as well as the substance of leadership sense-\\nmaking is shaped during interactions. as wiley notes, however, the\\nintersubjective level is often neglected in social theory, yet seems es-\\nsential to describe powerful influences on sensegiving and sensemaking\\nessential to leadership emergence. the level above interaction is that of\\nsocial structure. generic subjective focuses on the demands, constraints,\\nand objectives placed on the individual as a function of the immediate\\nsocial setting. the generic subjective occurs as concrete selves are left\\nbehind and the understanding is seen as “a reified social structure, in-\\ncluding interaction patterns, role relationships, common purpose, and\\ntaken-for-granted beliefs” (ashforth, rogers, & corley, 2011, p. 1146)\\nwhich often reflect a group identity (van knippenberg, 2018). finally,\\nthe most abstract level is the extrasubjective level of culture. at this\\nlevel, focus shifts from the subjective experiences of individuals to pure\\nmeaning, which is an abstract idealized reality.\\n\\nwe believe the study of emergent leadership phenomena is ripe for\\nfurther exploration using the insights of complexity perspectives on\\nemergence and wiley's idea of the leveled character of social reality.\\ngiven that emergent phenomena are multilevel and process-oriented,\\nwe use both of these perspectives to introduce three emergence\\n\\nprinciples, which served as foci for our review of the leadership\\nemergence literature. to be clear, these principles are not new and are\\nlargely derived from previous works within multilevel theory\\n(kozlowski & klein, 2000), which have been used primarily to further\\nthe study of group/team dynamics. in relying on these works, we first\\nidentify the individual-level elements at which leadership emergence is\\nthought to originate. the individual level elements are analogous to\\nwiley's conceptualization of the self. then we identify the process\\nmechanisms by which the individual elements are integrated, bridging\\nwiley's levels of intersubjective and generic subjective. finally,\\nkozlowski et al. (2013) also discuss the importance of addressing the\\npotential variation in the emergent outcome over time and we include\\nthis aspect as the third principle. as we do this, we pay particular at-\\ntention to deeper levels of emerging structures such as relational and\\ncollective identities (brewer & gardner, 1996) because they often\\nsupport more obvious surface structures such as social exchanges\\n(flynn, 2005) and leadership behavior (johnson, venus, lanaj, mao, &\\nchang, 2012).\\n\\nfinally, it is important to note that, while not explicitly incorporated\\ninto these emergence principles, the leadership emergence process is\\nexpected to be situated within a greater context of both informal re-\\nlationships as well as formal organizational structures. as kozlowski\\net al. (2013) note, “although it is not a core characteristic of emergence\\nper se, contextual factors at the higher-level shape and constrain the\\nprocess dynamics of emergence” (p. 585). in our review and subsequent\\nintegrative framework, we focus on identifying the central principles\\nthat drive the bottom-up process of leadership emergence. accordingly,\\nwhile not within the aims of this paper, we do acknowledge that these\\nemergence principles are situated within a greater organizational con-\\ntext.\\n\\nemergence principle #1: elemental properties of the emergent process\\n\\naccording to multilevel theory, every emergence process is char-\\nacterized by its lower-level elements or components. elements can re-\\npresent everything from neurons and cognitions to attitudes, behaviors,\\ninformation, and events, which meaningfully impact the emergence\\nprocess (kozlowski et al., 2013; morgeson & hofmann, 1999; roberts,\\nhulin, & rousseau, 1978; vallacher et al., 2015). these elemental\\nproperties are critical to understanding an emergent process because\\nthey serve as the micro-level building blocks to a higher-level outcome\\n(klein & kozlowski, 2000). elemental properties represent the in-\\ntrasubjective level of wiley's (1988) theory of levels. leadership\\nemergence theories that address this component of emergence serve to\\nanswer the questions of what elements are relevant to the emergence\\nprocess, how much of each element impacts the process, and what type\\nof effect it is has on the emergence process.\\n\\nemergence principle #2: mechanisms involved in the emergence process\\n\\nidentifying the elemental properties by themselves only captures the\\nlower-level “ingredients” to the emergence process, but it does not\\ncapture how and why these various elements function together to form\\nthe higher-level emergent outcome. according to multilevel theory, in\\norder to have an understanding of the process of emergence, it is ne-\\ncessary to both define what the elemental properties are as well as to\\ndefine the processes by which they are coordinated (cronin, weingart,\\n& todorova, 2011; kozlowski & klein, 2000). self-organization pro-\\nvides an explanation for the emergence of higher-order patterns as in-\\ndividual elements adjust to one another (vallacher et al., 2015). self-\\norganization is rarely a one-step process, but rather typically involves\\nmany iterations of mutual adjustment among elements before they are\\nsufficiently organized to promote a system-level property (hopfield,\\n1984). similar to wiley's (1988) intersubjective level of interaction, the\\nelements are transformed through interaction. in order for a theory to\\nsatisfy emergence principle two, specific works must outline the “rules”\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\n\\nthat determine how the leadership emergence process unfolds. more-\\nover, mechanisms can occur at various levels (lichtenstein, 2014),\\nwhich allows researchers to make links across multiple units of analysis,\\nsuch that insights from one level might be applied to others.\\n\\nemergence principle #3: form/function of the emergence outcome\\n\\nany emergence process cannot be adequately understood without\\ndefining the appropriate form/function of the eventual outcome.\\nkozlowski and klein (2000) made a point of emphasizing that emergent\\noutcomes are not fixed, but variable in nature; they often evolve and\\nchange. thus, the third principle is critical in understanding an emer-\\ngent process because it describes the dynamics of the phenomenon after\\nit has emerged. according to kozlowski (2015), while emergent phe-\\nnomena like leadership emergence are often treated as stable once they\\nemerge, they may in fact demonstrate “within-team variability over\\ntime, growth trajectories, and/or other types of trajectories (i.e., cy-\\ncles)” (p. 275). this idea is consistent with wiley's (1988) notion that\\nemergence does not just happen once and then stop, as well as\\nlichtenstein's (2014) distinction between dynamic states and emergent\\noutcomes. it can also be seen in the notion of leadership functions being\\nspread across group members (morgeson et al., 2010) or across orga-\\nnizations (dechurch et al., 2011) and time.\\n\\ntherefore, when theorizing about an emergent process, it is critical\\nto incorporate these temporal considerations, which involve the emer-\\ngent outcome after it has emerged. in order for a theory or research to\\nsatisfy emergence principle three, it also must describe the changes in\\nthe emergent outcome over time. this can include the form of change\\nthat the outcome demonstrates (e.g. discrete, non-linear changes), and\\nother temporal characteristics of the outcome (e.g. how quickly changes\\noccur). kozlowski et al. (2013) state that both the emergent process and\\nresulting outcome cannot be fully understood without discussing one\\nanother. accordingly, the elements (principle one), the interactions\\n(principle two) and the dynamics of the emergent outcome (principle\\nthree) are all necessary to gain a complete understanding of any\\nemergent property. overall, by applying these three principles derived\\nfrom multilevel theory to the study of leadership emergence, we argue\\nthat important insights can be gained regarding the underlying pro-\\ncesses driving leadership emergence.\\n\\nsystematic review and article mapping\\n\\nto perform the review, the existing leadership emergence literature\\nwas mapped onto the three emergence principles. we first performed an\\nextensive electronic literature search using web of science. specifically,\\nwe searched for the following terms in the title, abstract, and keywords\\nof articles: “leadership emergence”, “leader emergence”, “emergent\\nleadership”, “emergent leader”, “leadership process”, “leadership dy-\\nnamics”, “multilevel leadership”, “informal leadership”, “shared lea-\\ndership”, “distributed leadership”, and “team leadership”, and elimi-\\nnated any sources not related to psychology or business. articles from\\nother areas were included if they were deemed to make a unique con-\\ntribution to understanding the process of leadership and were con-\\nsistent with the psychology and business literature in their con-\\nceptualization of emergence. this original search list included 709\\narticles. then, using the references from these articles, we identified\\nand included any additional articles that were not in the initial search if\\nthey specifically discussed leadership emergence. our final sample in-\\ncluded articles published between 1941 and 2016.\\n\\nnext, we applied the following selection criteria. first, articles had\\nto be original research, whether qualitative, quantitative, theoretical, or\\nological, thus eliminating works such as letters, editorials, and\\nbook chapters. review articles were only included if they made specific\\ncontributions to understanding leadership emergence beyond sum-\\nmarizing what previous works found. second, we eliminated articles\\nbased upon their relevance to leadership emergence. to do so, we first\\n\\nremoved articles that did not include information about leadership\\nperceptions or the development of collective leadership as an outcome.\\nfinally, any article that was primarily focused on formal leaders, or did\\nnot discuss informal leadership, was removed. after eliminating articles\\nthat did not fit the above criteria, 189 articles remained (a full list of the\\narticles considered and chosen is available upon request).\\n\\nmapping procedure and categories\\n\\narticle information\\nwe created a database including year, journal, authors, and the title\\n\\nof the journal article. additionally, articles were recorded as empirical\\nor conceptual, and within the empirical category, they were recorded as\\neither longitudinal or cross-sectional. to be clear, we relied on a stricter\\ndefinition of longitudinal, in that articles had to include the leadership\\nemergence outcome for at least three time points, following previous\\nrecommendations (ployhart & vandenberg, 2010; singer & willett,\\n2003).\\n\\nprinciples\\nthe first and fourth authors mapped articles to the three emergence\\n\\nprinciples previously described. they reviewed the first 100 articles\\nfrom the original list together to obtain sufficient evidence of agree-\\nment in the article review process, then continued reviewing and\\nmapping the remaining articles independently. after eliminating all\\nnon-emergence articles, the remaining 189 were mapped onto the three\\nemergence principles (elements, process mechanisms, and form/func-\\ntion of the emergent outcome) using the criteria described below.\\n\\nspecifically, an article was identified as fitting principle one if it\\nidentified an individual characteristic (i.e. element) that impacts lea-\\ndership emergence. specifically, these were person-level properties that\\nwere described as having an effect on who emerged as a leader/fol-\\nlower (i.e. not simply a control variable). consistent with hollander's\\n(1974) treatment of “leadership elements”, we mapped each element as\\neither leader-focused or follower-focused (or both). an article was\\nmapped onto principle two if it described and/or tested the process of\\nleadership emergence. this principle included articles that described\\nthe phases or steps leading to leadership emergence and identified the\\nmechanisms which focus on the “how” of leadership emergence. in\\naddition, we identified the specific process mechanisms described in\\neach principle two paper (between two and four mechanisms); we then\\ncategorized each mechanism across the three primary levels of emer-\\ngence (individual, relational, or collective). next, we grouped the\\nprocess mechanisms identified in all articles into subcategories within\\neach level. finally, an article was mapped onto principle three if it\\nexamined or described the temporal dynamics of leadership emergence\\nover time. this included both the form of change and other char-\\nacteristics of the outcome over time (e.g. linearity).\\n\\nprinciples were not considered mutually exclusive, as articles could\\nfit multiple principles. for example, hall, workman, and marchioro\\n(1998) investigated both the gender of the leader, as well as the be-\\nhavioral flexibility and information processing that occurs within the\\nprocess of informal leadership perceptions; thus, this article was\\nmapped onto both principle one and principle two. similarly, sub-ca-\\ntegories within principles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. for\\ninstance, in principle one, articles may have described multiple ele-\\nments of leader emergence (e.g. personality and gender).\\n\\nresults of the systematic review\\n\\noverall, principle one represented the largest category, containing\\n139 articles. principle two contained 47 articles, and principle three\\ncontained 28 articles (see fig. 1).1 not surprisingly, there was an\\n\\n1 this total exceeds 189 because 12% of articles were mapped onto more than\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n148\\n\\n\\n\\nincreasing trend of publications on leadership emergence over time\\nfrom 1941 to 2016 (see fig. 1). articles were mainly empirical (157) as\\nopposed to conceptual. within the empirical articles, they were mainly\\ncross-sectional (137), as opposed to longitudinal.\\n\\nprinciple #1\\nof the 139 total articles representing principle one, 95% were em-\\n\\npirical, and only 7% of the empirical articles were longitudinal. the\\noverwhelming majority of articles included leader elements (137), with\\nonly 11 including follower elements. there were nine articles that\\ncontained both follower and leader elements. when categorizing the\\nelements into smaller subcategories (for both follower and leader ele-\\nments), personality (n=46), gender (n=43), and behavior (n=38)\\nwere the three most prevalent elements investigated. over time, the\\nfrequency of behavioral elements was the most consistent across years,\\nwith a noticeable proportion between the years of 1950–1979.\\nadditionally, studies which included behavioral elements noticeably\\nincreased from 1990 to 1999, decreased from 2000 to 2009, before\\nrising again in recent years. the study of gender as an element in-\\ncreased a large amount from 1980 to 1999 before remaining stable from\\n2000 to 2009 and then decreasing from 2010 to 2016. finally, the\\nfrequency of personality as an element increased substantially over the\\nyears of 1990–2009 and has remained relatively stable. overall, the\\nfrequency of principle one articles has increased over time. for a list of\\nthe major element subcategories along with the associated findings, see\\ntable 1.\\n\\nprinciple #2\\nthere were a total of 47 articles mapped onto principle two. of the\\n\\nprinciple two articles, 53% were conceptual, and of the empirical ar-\\nticles, 32% were longitudinal. when examining the level of the emer-\\ngent process, we found that 21 of the articles included individual-level\\nprocess mechanisms, 40 included relational-level process mechanisms,\\nand 27 articles included collective-level process mechanisms. many of\\n\\nthe articles discussed the process mechanisms at more than one level,\\nwith 16 articles at the individual and relational level, 14 articles at the\\nrelational and collective level, and five articles being mapped on all\\nthree levels.\\n\\nat each of the three levels of the emergence process, we grouped\\nprocess mechanisms into subcategories by identifying common themes.\\nwe developed the subcategories by identifying the process mechanisms\\nthat were conceptually similar and were discussed as holding a similar\\npurpose within the emergence process. when examining the 21 process\\nmechanisms at the individual level, the top two process mechanism sub-\\ncategories were self-schema/identity work (12) and task contribution (6).\\nwhen examining the 59 process mechanisms at the relational level, the\\ntop two process mechanisms were adapting to follower/task expectations\\n(23), and leadership prototype activation (10). finally, when examining\\nthe 46 process mechanisms at the collective level, the top three process\\nmechanisms were collective patterning of interactions (12), resolving ten-\\nsions (10), and social identification (6). overall, the frequency of prin-\\nciple two articles generally increased over time. a list of the major\\ntheoretical perspectives which discussed the process of leadership\\nemergence, along with their primary process mechanisms, organized by\\nlevel, appears in table 2.\\n\\nprinciple #3\\nthere were a total of 28 articles that mapped onto principle three.\\n\\nof those articles, 18% were conceptual and of the empirical articles,\\n48% were longitudinal. from the various findings in principle three,\\nthree themes were identified: (1) dynamism of leadership emergence\\nover time (n=17), (2) the form of change (i.e. linearity) (n=11), and\\n(3) the life cycle of the team (n=7). overall, the frequency of principle\\nthree articles increased sharply from 1970 to 2009 before decreasing\\nslightly from 2010 to 2016. a full list of the principle three findings\\nappears in table 3.\\n\\ngeneral themes\\nfrom the initial findings, we identified general themes and trends\\n\\nfor the principles. across all articles, twice as many articles were ca-\\ntegorized as principle one,

research\\n(dinh et al., 2014), these results suggest an overemphasis on the role of\\nperson factors on leadership emergence and an underemphasis on\\nprocess mechanisms and the dynamics of the construct.\\n\\nfor principle one, the articles were leader-focused, with most of the\\nelements centered on personality, behavior, and gender. in contrast,\\narticles that were mapped onto principle two emphasized the role of the\\nfollower; at the relational level, adapting to follower expectations was one\\nof the most frequent process mechanism subcategories identified,\\nhighlighting the importance of the follower in the leadership process.\\nthis evidence provides further support for the increasing importance of\\nthe study of followership (uhl-bien, riggio, lowe, & carsten, 2014).\\noverall, principle two had the greatest percentage of conceptual articles\\ncompared to the other principles. we presume this was due to the\\ncomplexity of studying leadership process mechanisms empirically\\n(fischer, dietz, & antonakis, 2016).\\n\\nprinciple three had the most limited work. these articles were\\nmainly mapped as empirical. although a main component of this\\nprinciple required a discussion of the emergent state over time, many of\\nthe articles did not assess informal leadership longitudinally (using our\\ncriteria). overall, the results from principle three reflect the field's lack\\nof exploration of time (day, 2014), as well as a lack of discussion about\\nthe form change in emergence (wang, zhou, & liu, 2014).\\n\\nintegrative framework of leadership emergence\\n\\nas the results from the literature review illustrate, 25% of papers\\ndiscussed the underlying process mechanisms of leadership emergence\\n(see table 2). by using the information gathered primarily from these\\nworks, we now introduce our process-oriented framework of leadership\\nemergence which aims to address three major objectives. first, as a\\ncentral component of any emergent process is its multilevel nature\\n(kozlowski et al., 2013), we incorporate all three levels (individual,\\nrelational, and collective) of leadership emergence into our theoretical\\nframework. although previous theories have discussed informal lea-\\ndership processes across multiple levels (derue & ashford, 2010), our\\nreview indicated that previous theories tended to focus on one or two of\\nthese levels, rather than incorporate all levels (derue, 2011 being a\\nnotable exception); this tendency reflects trends found in the leadership\\nliterature as a whole (batistič, černe, & vogel, 2017). accordingly, in\\nour theoretical framework, we include mechanisms that have been\\ndiscussed primarily at the individual level (e.g. self-schema activation),\\nrelational level (e.g. claiming & granting), and collective level (e.g.\\ntension reduction) in one comprehensive framework of leadership\\nemergence.\\n\\nsecond, as emergent properties are defined by the mechanisms that\\ndrive the bottom-up process (kozlowski et al., 2013), we structure our\\ntheoretical framework to incorporate the most frequently occurring\\nprocess mechanisms, as identified in the review, starting at the in-\\ndividual level. from doing so, we identify the two fundamental me-\\nchanisms of leadership emergence: self-structures and enacted\\n\\nstructures. we elaborate on these specific categories in the following\\nsection.\\n\\nthe format of the framework is as follows. we first introduce the\\ncategories of self-structures and enacted structures which are used to\\ndescribe the fundamental mechanisms in the emergence process. next,\\nwe describe the emergence process as it occurs across levels, over time.\\nacross these three levels, we describe the process first in terms of the\\nrole of self-structural properties, followed by the role of enacted\\nstructural properties in the system. we incorporate the most common\\nprocess mechanisms and theories for each level, as was found in the\\nreview. finally, in developing a process-oriented framework, we in-\\ntroduce propositions that could be used to guide future empirical esti-\\nmation and the development of testable formal models (see grand et al.,\\n2016 and vancouver, weinhardt, & schmidt, 2010 for examples). we\\nbegin this process by providing specific propositions that represent the\\nemergence process at each level. these propositions are listed in\\ntable 4.\\n\\nfundamental mechanisms\\n\\nin describing the basic nature of organizations, weick (1979) stated\\nthat they are made up of “interlocked behaviors that are embedded in\\nconditionally related processes” (p. 2). this reflects the findings of the\\nliterature review, as papers described the emergence process in prin-\\nciple two using the mechanisms of either behaviors and subsequent\\ninteractions occurring across individuals, or the deeper-level self and\\ninformation processes occurring within individuals which reflect their\\nongoing interactions (see table 2). specifically, we labeled these two\\ncategories of leadership emergence mechanisms as self-structures and\\nenacted structures. self-structures refer to cognitions related to how\\nindividuals produce, process, and understand information about the self\\n(e.g. self-identity, self-schema, self-concept; nowak, vallacher, tesser,\\n& borkowski, 2000). enacted structures refer to the behaviors, ex-\\npressions, and communications that are performed to support an on-\\ngoing social construction process between leaders and followers\\n(weick, 1995). we believe self-schemas and self-identities reflect the\\ndeep structure of leadership emergence because they are a fundamental\\ninput into self-regulation (lord & brown, 2004; markus & wurf, 1987);\\nself-regulation in turn, produces adaptive behaviors (kanfer, frese, &\\njohnson, 2017), which we view as the surface structure indication of\\nleadership emergence. according to lord, gatti, and chui (2016), the\\nsensemaking perspective helps move beyond the static view of “lea-\\ndership as individuals” to a richer understanding of leadership as a\\nsocially constructed process that is situationally embedded, and occurs\\nacross multiple levels, over time. for example, ashforth and schinoff\\n(2016) emphasize the situational embeddedness and social construction\\nof identities as being part of a sensemaking process. thus, by using the\\norganizational sensemaking literature to organize the results from the\\nliterature review, previous theories describing separate processes oc-\\ncurring at different levels can be integrated into a complete, bottom-up\\nrepresentation of

acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\n\\nemergence of both surface and deep structures.\\nas theories describing organizational sensemaking continued to\\n\\ndevelop, the idea of organizational “sensegiving” was added to re-\\npresent a complementary process to sensemaking. we argue that both\\nsensemaking and sensegiving are central processes necessary to un-\\nderstand the leadership emergence process. sensemaking represents the\\nprocess by which individuals perceive and ultimately organize complex\\ninformation into a coherent narrative (weick, sutcliffe, & obstfeld,\\n2005), and the narrative they construct often reflects their personal\\nidentity-work (ibarra & barbulescu, 2010). in contrast, sensegiving re-\\npresents the process by which a constructed meaning is conveyed to\\nothers (hill & levenhagen, 1995), and this may also be reflected in\\nstories from which authentic leadership is inferred by others (shamir &\\neilam, 2005). sensegiving becomes particularly important within a\\ncollective leadership context where each individual has enacted a un-\\nique understanding of leadership and followership. as sensegiving\\nconcerns how individuals influence others into adapting their definition\\nof organization reality (gioia & chittipeddi, 1991), we incorporate both\\nsensegiving and sensemaking into the enacted structure portion of our\\ntheoretical framework in describing the process by which individuals\\ndevelop a shared reality of leadership. finally, although both sense-\\nmaking and sensegiving help an individual construct their individual\\nmeaning within a collective (i.e. self-processes), both are viewed as\\nsocial activities (maitlis, 2005), in that individuals use action to con-\\nstruct both self-understandings (sensemaking), as well as shape the\\nunderstandings of others (sensegiving). therefore, while sensegiving\\nand sensemaking inform both self-structures and enacted structures,\\nthey occur within the processes related to enacted structures.\\n\\nthroughout the explication of our process-oriented theoretical fra-\\nmework of leadership emergence, table 5 is intended to serve as a vi-\\nsual representation. this table illustrates the specific self-structural\\nchanges and enacted structural changes that occur in a hypothetical\\nfour-person group (a, b, c, d). this table is also intended to represent\\nthe progression from the individual to the relational to the collective\\nlevels.\\n\\nindividual level\\n\\nself-structures\\n\\nthe largest portion of the theories at the individual level (57%)\\ndiscussed the role of self-views, self-schema, and self-identity (emery,\\ndaniloski, & hamby, 2011; hall & lord, 1995; lord, brown, & freiberg,\\n1999). according to these perspectives, how individuals proceed to act\\nas both leaders and followers within a collective is largely a function of\\nhow they view themselves as a leader within a given domain (hannah,\\nwoolfolk, & lord, 2009). according to this view, individuals have ex-\\npectations for leadership prior to interacting with others. work on\\nleader and follower identity suggests that individuals specifically rely\\non self-schemas, which are cognitive structures that shape the affective,\\ncognitive, and behavioral responses of individuals in each context (lord\\net al., 1999; markus & wurf, 1987). self-schemas are domain specific\\n(e.g. leadership domain), and they serve to help individuals retrieve\\nnecessary information to adapt to changing goals within a given social\\ncontext (cross & markus, 1994). therefore, some individuals will have\\na self-schema for leadership, and these self-schemas will guide both\\ntheir perceptions of others and their behavioral responses within a\\nleadership context.\\n\\na critical understanding about self-schemas is that they are acti-\\nvated by specific situational cues and primes (lord et al., 2016).\\ntherefore, depending on the particular social context, people will shift\\nbetween leader and follower schemas (i.e. only one will be activated at\\na particular moment). for example, if a

environment and the other\\nindividuals within the collective (i.e. social situation).\\n\\nin addition, previous research has demonstrated that there will be\\nmeaningful between-person variability in the strength of self-schema\\nwithin a given domain depending on the prior experience of in-\\ndividuals. according to markus (1977), the strength of a self-schema is\\nindicated by the extent that individuals can: (a) process information\\nabout the self in the given domain with relative ease, (b) retrieve be-\\nhavioral evidence from the domain, (c) predict their own future beha-\\nvior in the domain, and (d) resist counter schematic information about\\nthemselves. individuals that have a well-developed leadership self-\\nschema would be high on these factors and would be viewed as\\n“schematic” in the leadership domain (lord et al., 1999). this point is\\ncritical as research shows that the relative strength of leadership self-\\nschemas meaningfully impacts whether people will adopt leadership\\nroles (smith, brown, lord, & engle, 1998) or produce leadership be-\\nhaviors (johnson et al., 2012). accordingly, we argue that individuals\\n\\nwith a more developed leadership self-schema related to a given context\\nwill be more likely to enact a leadership role early in the leadership\\nemergence process.\\n\\nfinally, by adopting recent process approaches to leader identity\\n(lord et al., 2016), further understanding can be generated about the\\nrole of self-structures in the leadership emergence process by differ-\\nentiating them from self-identities. specifically, although previous\\nworks discuss leader and follower identity as critical self-structures in\\nthe emergence process (e.g. emery et al., 2011), more recent works\\nsuggest that leader identities do not develop until an individual's lea-\\ndership self-schema becomes contextualized into the ongoing social\\nprocesses within the collective (epitropaki et al., 2017; lord et al.,\\n2016; lord & chui, 2017).\\n\\nas this conscious, situated identity is constructed, each person uses\\ntheir previous experience, self-schema, and salient values to enact an\\nidentity that is

structure emergence has individual, relational, and collec-\\ntive identity consequences. our review extends this idea by empha-\\nsizing that identity development involves a deeper structure than lea-\\ndership claims and social grants of leadership discussed by derue and\\nashford (2010). constructing situated identities in any area, including\\nleadership, is a complex self-regulatory process that engages many self-\\nmotives, involves affect and cognitive processes, and involves crafting a\\nself-narrative that will be socially accepted. interestingly, individuals\\nhave dedicated neural structures, called default networks, for\\ngrounding the self in task, social, and historical contexts (raichle et al.,\\n2001).\\n\\nin representing the role of self-structures early in the leadership\\nemergence process, it is important to incorporate the factors that will\\nimpact the activation of a specific leader self-schema within a context.\\nalthough concepts such as gender are central to the self-concept of most\\nindividuals and are therefore chronically available (markus, crane,\\nbernstein, & siladi, 1982), leader self-schemas are not presumed to be\\nchronically available, but instead are activated as a function of addi-\\ntional factors (lord et al., 1999). first, as previously described, leader\\nand follower schema activation will be a function of both the task and\\nthe other individuals in the collective—what we label as the social si-\\ntuation. to be clear, as these are informal adhoc groups, at this point in\\nthe emergence process, other informal relational structures have not\\ndeveloped yet (e.g. friendship network; carter et al., 2015). thus, in the\\nschema activation process, the social situation reflects what is described\\nas a self-focused dynamic construal process in which the individual uses\\ncues related to the task and the individuals within their group, to ac-\\ntivate a specific self-schema (freeman & ambady, 2011). these cues\\n(e.g. race of others, task requirements) make up the social context\\nvariable, and can be described as what oc (2018) labeled as discrete task\\nand social factors. second, research suggests that the activation of par-\\nticular self-schemas is impacted by whether individuals are motivated\\nto process self-related information (bober & grolnick, 1995). for ex-\\nample, within the leadership context, individuals that are more com-\\nmitted to collective or organizational goals are more likely to activate\\nappropriate leadership self-schemas (lord et al., 2016). this individual-\\nlevel cognitive structure can differ among group members reflecting a\\ndynamic group level leadership structure or mental model, a point we\\nwill return to later.\\n\\nbased on the above rationale we now turn to the first step in de-\\nveloping specific propositions which represent aspects of the micro\\nprocesses associated with leadership emergence. although the various\\npropositions operate holistically and reflect the dynamics of a complex\\nsystem, they necessarily must be developed individually. thus, while\\nmultiple individuals can emerge simultaneously within a collective, we\\nstart by focusing on individuals. we begin by representing the process\\nof leadership self-schema activation for one person at a specific time\\npoint using the following proposition.\\n\\nproposition 1. the activation of a leadership self-schema at a particular\\npoint in time will depend on context at that time, prior experience in similar\\ncontexts, and motivational states.\\n\\nas noted by epitropaki et al. (2017) and derue (2011), at the in-\\ndividual level, the dynamic interplay between leader-follower identities\\nis critical. thus, in addition to schemas regarding leadership, self-\\nschemas regarding followership are equally important. we posit that\\nthe activation of a follower self-schema is based on factors similar to\\nthose specified in proposition 1.\\n\\nproposition 2. : the activation of a followership self-schema at a particular\\npoint in time will depend on context at that time, prior experience in similar\\ncontexts, and motivational states.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nat the individual level, the primary process mechanism underlyingta\\nbl\\ne\\n5\\n\\nem\\ner\\nge\\n\\nnc\\ne,\\n\\nse\\nns\\neg\\n\\niv\\nin\\ng,\\n\\nse\\nns\\nem\\n\\nak\\nin\\ng,\\n\\nan\\nd\\nse\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\nin\\n\\n4-\\npe\\n\\nrs\\non\\n\\ngr\\nou\\n\\nps\\n(a\\n\\n,b\\n,c\\n\\n,d\\n).\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\ntr\\nuc\\n\\ntu\\nre\\n\\nen\\nac\\nte\\nd\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne\\n\\na\\n's\\nse\\n\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nb\\n's\\nse\\n\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nid\\nen\\n\\nti\\nty\\n\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nse\\n\\nns\\neg\\n\\niv\\nin\\ng\\n\\nse\\nns\\n\\nem\\nak\\n\\nin\\ng\\n\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nof\\n\\nan\\nal\\nys\\n\\nis\\nc\\non\\n\\nte\\nxt\\nua\\n\\nlly\\npr\\nim\\n\\ned\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\n\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nor\\n\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\n\\nac\\nti\\nva\\n\\nte\\nd\\n\\nin\\ndi\\nvi\\ndu\\n\\nal\\nle\\n\\nad\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nen\\nac\\ntm\\n\\nen\\nt\\nba\\n\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nm\\nat\\nch\\n\\nto\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\nan\\n\\nd\\nco\\n\\nnt\\nex\\nt\\n(a\\n\\n)\\nin\\ndi\\nvi\\ndu\\n\\nal\\n\\nso\\nci\\nal\\nly\\n\\nco\\nnfi\\n\\nrm\\ned\\n\\n(o\\nr\\n\\nre\\nje\\nct\\ned\\n\\n)\\nse\\nlf\\n-i\\nde\\n\\nnt\\nit\\ny\\n\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nse\\nlf\\n-s\\nch\\n\\nem\\na\\nac\\nti\\nva\\n\\nte\\nd\\nto\\n\\nsu\\npp\\n\\nor\\nt\\nco\\n\\nnfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nof\\n\\na\\n's\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nr\\nel\\nat\\nio\\nna\\n\\nl(\\nro\\nle\\n\\nre\\nla\\nti\\non\\n\\nsh\\nip\\ns\\nde\\n\\nfi\\nne\\n\\nso\\nci\\nal\\n\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne)\\n\\nc\\non\\n\\nfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nor\\n\\nde\\nni\\nal\\n\\nof\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\nsh\\nip\\n\\nac\\nt\\n\\nba\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nm\\nat\\nch\\n\\nto\\nb'\\ns\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne\\nr\\nel\\nat\\nio\\nna\\n\\nl\\n\\nex\\nem\\n\\npl\\nifi\\nes\\n\\ngr\\nou\\n\\np\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne\\nb-\\nd\\n\\nha\\nve\\n\\nad\\nop\\n\\nte\\nd\\nfo\\nllo\\n\\nw\\ner\\n\\nid\\nen\\n\\nti\\nty\\n\\nc\\nol\\nle\\nct\\niv\\ne\\nde\\n\\nfi\\nni\\nti\\non\\n\\nof\\nle\\nad\\n\\ner\\n(e\\nxe\\nm\\npl\\nar\\n\\nm\\nod\\n\\nel\\n,b\\n\\nut\\nov\\n\\ner\\nti\\nm\\ne\\nit\\nca\\nn\\nbe\\n\\nco\\nm\\ne\\n\\npr\\not\\not\\nyp\\n\\ne)\\n\\nh\\nig\\nhe\\n\\nr\\nle\\nve\\n\\nl\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne\\nem\\n\\ner\\nge\\n\\ns\\nfr\\nom\\n\\nlo\\nca\\nl\\n\\n(a\\nb,\\n\\na\\nc\\n,a\\n\\nd\\net\\nc.\\n)\\nre\\nla\\nti\\non\\n\\ns\\n(h\\n\\nop\\nfi\\nel\\nd,\\n\\n19\\n82\\n\\n)\\n\\nc\\non\\n\\nfi\\nrm\\n\\nat\\nio\\nn\\nof\\n\\nde\\nni\\nal\\n\\nba\\nse\\nd\\non\\n\\nsh\\nar\\ned\\n\\n,\\nen\\n\\nac\\nte\\nd\\nun\\n\\nde\\nrs\\nta\\nnd\\n\\nin\\ng\\n\\ng\\nro\\nup\\n\\n(i\\nnt\\ner\\nac\\nti\\non\\n\\ns\\nov\\n\\ner\\nti\\nm\\ne\\n\\ncr\\nea\\nte\\n\\nm\\nes\\no\\nst\\nru\\nct\\nur\\ne)\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\n\\nenacted processes was the contribution towards the group task (29%;\\nbales, 1958; hollander, 1958; stogdill, 1959). these behaviors are\\nviewed, as a reflection of individuals' conception and future expecta-\\ntions for leadership within a given group (hollander, 1974). the group\\ncontext signals what needs to be considered to deduce appropriate\\nsensegiving behaviors. sensegiving behaviors provide direction and\\nfoster integration that enables group effectiveness (kozlowski, watola,\\njensen, kim, & botero, 2009). stein and heller (1979) stated that “the\\ndevelopment of task leadership roles is the major thesis of emergent\\nleadership theories” (p. 1994). consequently, we argue that the per-\\nformance of these acts is a critical component in the sensegiving process\\nwithin leadership emergence (see table 5). weick's (1979) notion of\\nenacted sensemaking represents this stage of the emergence process.\\n\\nin studying how individual behaviors change over the leadership\\nemergence process, research found that early in the emergence process,\\npeople focus solely on task requirements, whereas later on, they change\\ntheir behaviors based on how the original actions are perceived by\\nothers within the collective (strickland et al., 1978). this supports the\\nclaim that, at an early stage in the emergence process, individuals are\\nperforming actions based on their prior experiences within that context,\\nnot the social confirmation or denial of others. thus, initially the\\namount and type of leadership acts performed by individuals are ex-\\npected to be largely a function of their leadership self-schema. speci-\\nfically, we argue that the probability of a leader behavior by a parti-\\ncular person at one time depends on both leader and follower self-\\nschemas.\\n\\nproposition 3. : the probability that an individual will perform a\\nleadership behavior at a specific time will be based on whether the\\nactivation of their leader self-schema is greater than their follower self-\\nschema at that time.\\n\\nalthough for expositional purposes in propositions 1–3, we re-\\npresent these social processes as not yet developing past the individual\\nlevel, relational and group contexts may be part of the situation that\\nactivates leader or follower schemas. subsequently “reflected-ap-\\npraisal” processes will play a critical role at the relational level of the\\nemergence process (lord & brown, 2004). further, the social processes\\ninvolved in constructing situated identities emerge through a series of\\nactions that play out over time (derue, 2011) and involve resolution of\\nthe ambiguity regarding oneself in a given situation (ashforth &\\nschinoff, 2016). this could be represented by cumulating (more pre-\\ncisely, integrating) propositions 1–3 over a given time period.\\n\\nrelational level\\n\\nself-structure\\n\\nat the relational level, many theories in the literature review de-\\nscribe the emergence process using leaders' adjustment to the ex-\\npectations of followers (39%); additionally, other works focused on the\\nnegotiation of leader-follower identities among members of the collec-\\ntive (derue, 2011; derue & ashford, 2010; marchiondo et al., 2015).\\nin terms of the self, these works describe leadership emergence as the\\nprocess of mutual identity construction occurring across individuals\\nwith differing expectations for leadership. once the emergence process\\nreaches the relational level, the expectation is that individuals have\\nbegun to incorporate social feedback in forming a socially-constructed\\nleader identity; thus, we argue that the formation of a socially em-\\nbedded leader identity serves as evidence that the emergence process\\nhas begun to emphasize the relational level. this is not a discrete\\ntransition, but a gradual shift in emphasis, that merges intra-individual\\nwith inter-individual identity processes.\\n\\nthe critical change that occurs in moving from the individual to the\\nrelational level is that an individual's leader self-identity has an in-\\ncreasingly important social component. for example, in derue and\\nashford's (2010) model of “claiming and granting”, whether an\\n\\nindividual's “claim” of leadership is “granted” by others within a col-\\nlective is critical to determining whether they will maintain a leader\\nidentity. however, there is ambiguity regarding such processes. for\\nexample, whether an individual's actions fit with a leadership prototype\\nis a matter of degree, not an all or nothing process (lord et al., 2001;\\nrosch & lloyd, 1978), and different individuals may hold different\\nleadership prototypes, creating ambiguity in how they interpret and\\nrespond to group activities. by combining these works with works on\\nfollowership self-schemas (lord et al., 1999), we argue that at a deeper\\nlevel, this process of social confirmation is driven by in part by the self-\\nschemas of followers. specifically, if the actions of a leader activate a\\nfollower self-schema in others, then the leader identity of the pro-\\nspective leader is socially confirmed (shondrick & lord, 2010). fur-\\nthermore, other works categorized at the relational level describe the\\nimportant role of followers' implicit leadership theory (ocker, huang,\\nbenbunan-fich, & hiltz, 2011) in the schema activation process. im-\\nportantly, what is occurring over time is the creation of a relation\\namong actors and perceivers that involves the bidirectional effects of\\nidentity activation for both parties to a social exchange. typically, re-\\nlations stabilize by creating an attractor (a double interact) that de-\\npends on the active identities of both parties. this is represented in\\npropositions 4–6, which although developed separately, operate as a\\nsystem that evolves over time.\\n\\nat a basic level, implicit leader theories (ilt) refer to follower\\nprototypes for leaders within a given context (lord, foti, & de vader,\\n1984). according to this work, an individual is more likely to perceive\\nsomeone else as leader if the prospective leader's behaviors coincide\\nwith the follower's expectations for leadership (nye & forsyth, 1991).\\ntaken together, in the process of leadership emergence, we argue that if\\nthere is a match between the characteristics and behaviors of the pro-\\nspective leader and the leadership prototype of perceivers, then they\\nwill apply the category “leader” to the social target depending on the\\ngoodness of fit to their ilt. finally, it is important to note that this\\nprocess is occurring within each dyad, signifying that this dyadic process\\nis occurring across multiple individuals simultaneously within the\\noverall collective. based on this rationale, we represent the extent of\\nleadership perception towards one perspective leader by one perspec-\\ntive follower as the match between the prospective leader's character-\\nistics and the prospective follower's ilt.\\n\\nproposition 4. : leadership perception for a specific individual at a specific\\ntime will be based on the match between the perceiver's ilt and the\\nprospective leader's perceived characteristics.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nhowever, leadership perception is not a passive one-directional\\nprocess. perceiving another as a leader has implications for the per-\\nceiver as well as actor, and it is likely to partially activate a corre-\\nsponding follower's self-schema. the confirmation of the prospective\\nleader's self-identity, ultimately involves the activation of compatible\\nroles that make sense of each party's identity in this situation and give\\nsense to the other party. in other words, underlying a double-interact in\\nterms of surface behaviors related to claiming and granting, is a deeper\\ndouble-interact that reflects the meaning of mutually reinforcing\\nidentities. further, this meaning is discovered by both parties as it is\\nenacted over time. this idea is reflected in sluss and ashforth's (2007)\\ndiscussion of relational identities as encompassing both self-identities\\nand role-based identities (e.g. follower). thus, at the relational level,\\nindividuals begin to act not simply because of self-schemas, but also\\nbased on whether others perceive and respond to them as a leader at\\nthat time.\\n\\nat the relational level, many theories discussed the enactment of\\nleadership emergence through a variation of what weick (1979) re-\\nferred to as double interacts (10%). according to these works (derue,\\n2011; li et al., 2007; marchiondo et al., 2015), interacts occur when the\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n156\\n\\n\\n\\nbehavior of one individual becomes contingent upon the behavior of\\nanother within the system. leadership at its basic nature represents\\ninterpersonal influence (kaiser, hogan, & craig, 2008), and double\\ninteracts are viewed as the “basic unit for describing interpersonal in-\\nfluence” (weick, 1979, p. 89). according to weick (2001), double in-\\nteracts serve as the precursor for collective understandings, because\\nindividuals justify their interactions using the collective as an ex-\\nplanation. for example, within the leadership context, if person a is\\nreflecting on their interactions with person b, they could use the ex-\\nplanation that “person b is a leader within our group, and that is why i\\ninteracted with them in that way”. thus, these interacts help inform\\neach person's understanding of leadership within the collective. alter-\\nnatively, individuals may not think explicitly about such roles, but ra-\\nther respond implicitly as leader and follower identities are constructed\\nover time through enactive processes.\\n\\nwhether constructed implicitly or explicitly, affectively or cogni-\\ntively, identities developed through double interacts reflect attractors\\nthat make sense of the past and can guide future interacts. thereby a\\npatterning of leader-follower interactions takes place (derue, 2011).\\naccording to shondrick and lord (2010), the social construction of\\nleadership occurs when (1) a potential leader perceives or infers a\\ngroup of individuals to be his or her followers and when (2) individuals\\nin a group begin to view themselves as being led by that prospective\\nleader. it is through these interacts that individuals begin to rely on\\nboth active self-schemas, situated provisional identities, as well as the\\nperceptions and reactions of others. thus, as previously argued, at the\\nrelational stage individuals begin to transition from leader and follower\\nself-schemas, to leader and follower identities, as their self-schemas\\nbecome socially confirmed through the double interacts.\\n\\nspecifically, at the dyadic level, the probability that a single person\\nwill have a leadership identity will be a function of their activation of\\nleadership self-schema, in addition to the leadership perception of a\\nprospective follower. furthermore, the probability that a person will\\nactivate a follower identity will be a function of their followership self-\\nschema in addition to whether they perceive the other person as a\\nleader. finally, as self-schema activation incorporates self-perceptions\\nwithin that given domain (markus & wurf, 1987), we represent the\\nprobability of activating leader and follower identities in propositions 5\\nand 6, respectively. it is important to note that proposition 5 includes a\\ncomponent pertaining to leaders and another pertaining to followers,\\nthus reflecting the mutual dependence in a double interact. proposition\\n6 reflects self-schema activation by the prospective follower as well as\\ntheir perceptions of their dyadic partner, which is an internal re-\\npresentation of a double interact held by this prospective follower.\\ntogether, propositions 5 and 6 are defined at a level that integrates\\none's self-identity with both the activation of internal knowledge\\nstructures, that is, self-schemas, and the leadership perception process.\\n\\nproposition 5. the probability that a leader identity is activated for a\\nperson depends on that person's activation of their leadership self-schema\\nand their dyadic partner's leadership perception of them at that time.\\n\\nproposition 6. the probability that a follower identity is activated for a\\nperson depends on that person's activation of their followership self-schema\\nand their perception that their dyadic partner is a leader at that time.\\n\\nthese interacts represent the micro elements of the process by\\nwhich leaders and followers negotiate their individualized internal re-\\npresentations of leadership (i.e. leadership self-structures). these ele-\\nments are not static, but as the indexing by time implies, they evolve\\nover time, as do leadership perceptions (see proposition 4). it is im-\\nportant to recognize that follower self-schemas have many positive\\nattributes such as being productive, going above and beyond, and being\\na team player (sy, 2010) that may be part of leadership processes as\\nwell. though one initially may have been guided by a follower schema,\\nindividuals who excel on these factors may be perceived by others as\\nexhibiting leadership, and communication of these social perceptions\\n\\nmay be part of the process that activates one's leadership schemas. in\\nother words, leadership may at times be recognized by others before\\nbeing recognized in oneself (alvesson & sveningsson, 2003; paunova,\\n2015).\\n\\nthis mutual form of enactment can be further represented by the\\nphenomenon of synchronization, which is a fundamental component to\\ndynamical systems (blasius, huppert, & stone, 1999). synchronization\\nrepresents the process by which two separate systems coupled within\\nthe same environment demonstrate identical or compatible dynamics\\nover time (rulkov, sushchik, tsimring, & abarbanel, 1995). a classic\\nexample of synchronization is the fact that metronomes operating at\\ndifferent tempos will synchronize to the same tempo when placed on a\\ncommon base (pantaleone, 2002). jiang et al. (2015) found that leader-\\nfollower relationships were characterized by neural synchronization\\nthat occurred over time. specifically, they measured the communica-\\ntion frequency and neural synchronization of groups performing a\\nleaderless group problem solving task and found that quality of com-\\nmunication predicted neural synchronization in emergent leader-fol-\\nlower relationships. this is critical, as during the process of sense-\\nmaking, double interacts enable individuals to develop shared\\nunderstandings of the social environment (weick, 2001). thus, we\\nargue that these leader-follower interactions form synchrony in beha-\\nvior over time, which begins to manifest as stable leader-follower re-\\nlationships that are grounded in situated identities, as well as the for-\\nmation of shared internal representations of leadership within the\\ncollective (self-structure).\\n\\nat this point in the emergence process, leadership may not have\\nfully emerged, as these double interacts may not developed into a stable\\npattern of interactions. weick (1979) argues that these interacts cannot\\nbe viewed as stable until both (1) the leaders actions become pre-\\ndictable and (2) the followers subsequent actions become predictable\\n(weick, 1979). in other words, the perceptions of both the leader and\\nfollower cross thresholds and both individuals become mutually inter-\\ndependent. we believe that once these two requirements are met,\\nleader and follower identities begin to solidify, and stable leader-fol-\\nlower relationships are formed. over time, we represent the relational\\nprocesses of leadership emergence as individuals performing actions as\\na function of their self-schema (proposition 3), as well as if past acts\\nhave been confirmed, which we argue is a direct function of the lea-\\ndership perceptions of prospective followers. therefore, through this\\nconfirmation process (driven by leadership perceptions and self-schema\\nactivation) stable leader and follower identities begin to form as role-\\nbased attractors in a dynamic, dyadic system and these attractors guide\\nsubsequent dyadic social interactions. but the interactions reflect only a\\nsurface structure that is supported by the deeper emergences of syn-\\nchronized identities as specified in propositions 4–6. we should stress\\nthat for expositional convenience, we have depicted these micro ele-\\nments of structure at the relational level as being independent of the\\ncollective level. we relax that assumption as we discuss leadership and\\nidentity structures at the collective level.\\n\\ncollective level\\n\\nself-structure\\n\\none of the common collective process mechanism found in papers\\nfrom our literature review was social identification (13%). most of\\nthese papers specifically included the “social identity theory of lea-\\ndership” (hogg, 2001). this theory builds from the relational level by\\ndescribing how individuals begin to view leadership in terms of specific\\ngroup prototypes, rather than their individualized leader prototypes\\n(reicher, haslam, & hopkins, 2005). at this point in the emergence\\nprocess, for one individual to emerge as a group leader, it is not enough\\nfor their behavior to activate follower self-schemas in others; in addi-\\ntion, emergence begins to occur once a prospective leader's actions fit to\\nthe group's leadership prototype (van knippenberg, van knippenberg,\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n157\\n\\n\\n\\nde cremer, & hogg, 2004). accordingly, at the collective level, once a\\npatterning of interactions results in followers contextualizing their\\nfollower schemas into a stable follower identity, this advances the\\nemergence process. furthermore, if all followers develop a follower\\nidentity in the context of a single prospective leader's actions, then that\\nindividual is likely to be exemplifying the leadership group prototype,\\nthe shared cognitive representation that the collective has for leader-\\nship (reicher et al., 2005).\\n\\nat the collective level, the process of social identification represents\\nthe critical “identity work” that underlies the emergence process.\\naccording to van knippenberg (2011), social identification represents\\nthe process by which the interests of the group become central to each\\nindividual's self-identity. thus, over the emergence process, through\\nsocial identification, individuals are expected to shift from viewing\\nleadership through their leadership self-schemas to viewing leadership\\nthrough the lens of their group. this process may be gradual and au-\\ntomatic as connectionist systems that support categorization processes\\nincorporate the group context into contextualized implicit leadership\\ntheories (lord, brown, & harvey, 2001). the primary motivational\\ndriver of this process is uncertainty reduction (hogg, 2007). according\\nto this perspective, viewing leadership differently than others within\\nthe collective creates uncertainty about the future. as individuals seek\\nto predict and control their social world (leotti, iyengar, & ochsner,\\n2010), this uncertainty leads to internal tensions which provokes an-\\nxiety and stress (hogg, 2001). thus, to reduce the negative effects of\\nuncertainty, individuals incorporate to a collective understanding of\\nleadership.\\n\\nas each group member begins to identify with the collective level,\\ntheir potential leader and follower identity becomes a function of both\\ntheir leader and follower dyadic self-identities, as well as the collective\\nleadership perceptions of others within the group. that is, the prob-\\nability that they will have a leader identity at the collective level be-\\ncomes a function of both their leader self-identities, as well as the\\ncollective leadership perceptions that others in the group have of them.\\nadditionally, the probability that an individual will activate a follower\\nidentity will be a function of their follower self-schema, as well as\\nwhether they—and others—perceive someone else as a perspective\\nleader at that time. we represent this process in propositions 7 and 8\\nwhich include an aggregation across group members of the dyadic level\\nleadership perceptions, to reflect the collective leadership identity of\\none person at a specific time point.\\n\\nproposition 7. at the collective level, the probability that a person's leader\\nidentity is activated depends on both their individual leadership self-schema\\nactivation, as well as the leadership perceptions of others towards them.\\n\\nproposition 8. at the collective level, the probability that a person's\\nfollower identity is activated depends on both their individual followership\\nself-schema activation, as well as the followership perceptions of others\\ntowards them.\\n\\npropositions 7 and 8 represent an independent aggregation across\\ndyads, or what has been labeled compositional aggregation (dinh et al.,\\n2014; kozlowski & klein, 2000; lord, hannah, & jennings, 2011). if,\\nhowever, the processes underlying dyadic identity formation interact\\nand form a new construct at the collective level, which in the next\\nparagraph we maintain is likely, then collective leadership identities\\nshould be qualitatively different than dyadic leader identities, a process\\nthat would be termed compilational aggregation. compilational ag-\\ngregation would also require adding a component which reflects the\\ninterdependence of dyadic processes, which is addressed in the fol-\\nlowing section on enacted structures.\\n\\nin connecting the individual-level schemas to the formation of col-\\nlective identities, social identification represents a meso process\\nwhereby individuals transition from external categorization to internal\\nidentification. according to social identity theory (tajfel & turner,\\n1986), social categorization is externally-oriented as it concerns others,\\n\\nand social identification is internally-oriented as it concerns the self\\n(jenkins, 2000). we argue that this distinction is critical to under-\\nstanding the process of leadership emergence because the interpreta-\\ntion of leadership changes orientations as the process crosses levels.\\nspecifically, at the lower levels, individuals view their interactions with\\nothers within the collective as external to their self-concept. however, if\\nthe process of social identification occurs, each person is expected to\\nthink about these collective interactions internally—in reference to\\nthemselves. we argue that the shift from external categorization to\\ninternal categorization begins to capture when leadership has emerged\\n(i.e. collective structure has formed). further, when an emergent leader\\nidentifies with a group and embodies the group prototype, her or his\\nown self-schema becomes more consistent with the group level cogni-\\ntive structure.\\n\\nenacted structure\\n\\nat the collective level, other common process mechanisms were the\\ncollective patterning of interaction (26%), and tension reduction (22%).\\nfurthermore, these mechanisms were primarily discussed in papers that\\nused complexity perspectives (e.g. lichtenstein et al., 2006; uhl-bien\\net al., 2007). according to these works, the emergence process is re-\\npresented by a patterning of leader-follower interactions over time.\\nhowever, complexity approaches go beyond leader-follower interac-\\ntions by discussing the collective mechanisms that operate at the group\\nlevel to drive the emergence process. the major mechanism at the\\ngroup level is the idea of tension reduction, in that the patterns of\\nleader-follower interactions serve to adaptively reduce tension and ul-\\ntimately reach collective goals (hazy, 2008). this reflects the idea of\\ncollective identity, as individuals seek to resolve the internal tension of\\nuncertainty experienced when competing conceptions of leadership\\noccur (hogg, 2001, 2007).\\n\\nin addition to the internal tension of uncertainty, the tension caused\\nby having to adapt to the external environment can be viewed as the\\nprimary external tension within the leadership emergence process\\n(schneider & somers, 2006). to illustrate how both these internal and\\nexternal tensions drive the leadership emergence process, we pair\\ncomplexity theory with two other non-linear dynamical systems: neural\\nnetworks (hopfield, 1984) and spin glass structures (stein & newman,\\n2013). according to theory on hopfield networks, over time a collective\\nof neurons explore different patterns of activation to reach the\\nminimum amount of energy required to produce an outcome (hopfield,\\n1984). regarding the emergence process, we argue that this represents\\nthe external tensions, as a collective must perform a specific pattern of\\nleader-follower interactions to meet the environmental requirements.\\nconsequently, we argue that over time, a collective will enact specific\\npatterns of double interacts between leaders and followers until the\\nmost efficient pattern is found.\\n\\nto extend the idea of neural networks to the internal tensions that\\ndrive leadership emergence, it helps to incorporate the concept of spin\\nglass structures, a common phenomenon used in complexity theory\\n(stein & newman, 2013). spin glasses are disordered magnetic mate-\\nrials which contain elements of polarity (i.e. positive or negative state).\\nthrough local interaction of each unit with adjacent units, the specific\\natoms within the structure move from disorder to a coherent global\\npattern. thus, the structure resolves the internal tension caused by\\ndisequilibrium across atoms by moving to a global state of equilibrium.\\nnot only is this transition to equilibrium fundamental in spin glass\\nstructures, but this is a central tenet to complexity leadership per-\\nspectives (schneider & somers, 2006). accordingly, we argue that just\\nas individual atoms within a spin glass structure change positions to\\nalign with the other atoms in the structure (or in terms we have de-\\nveloped create double interacts), through a series of interacts (weick,\\n1979), dyads shift their structure to align with other dyads in the col-\\nlective. for example, in a group of four people (a, b, c, d), if a and b\\nare in a leader-follower relationship, c will be more likely to develop a\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\n\\nfollower relationship to a. that is, the a-b double interact tends to\\n“flip” the a-c double interact; as this happens throughout a group, a\\nstable leadership structure emerges. furthermore, this alignment to the\\ncollective reduces the internal tensions driven by uncertainty (hogg,\\n2001).\\n\\nto reflect this between-dyad interaction, we would modify\\nproposition 4, which involves the match of leader characteristics to\\nfollower's ilt, to form proposition 9 which takes into account this\\ngroup context by introducing a bias component that reflects this effect\\nof other dyadic relations in a group. we assume that the biases invol-\\nving different pairs of dyads are encountered over time as attention\\nshifts from one dyadic comparison to another.\\n\\nproposition 9. the collective leadership perception towards one individual\\nin a group at one time depends on the match of the prospective leader's\\ncharacteristics to each group member's ilt's, as well as the additional biasing\\neffect of the other dyadic leadership relations in the group.\\n\\nproposition 9 thus translates the dyadic process into a group context\\nand reflects what klein, dansereau, and hall (1994) have termed a\\nparts within wholes relationship. we are arguing then that the group\\ncontext changes how dyadic leadership perceptions function through\\nthis biasing function that operates sequentially as a particular dyad ac\\nis compared to other dyads ab or ad. over time this comparison can\\nintroduce variability into how a is perceived by c, but eventually this\\nvariability will be reduced as a more uniform structure evolves and\\nthere are shared perceptions of person a by group members b, c, and d.\\nat this point a group-level attractor exists, and the biasing function\\nbecomes uniform across possible pairs of dyads, reflecting the evolved\\ncommon understanding or group context. in other words, group as well\\nas dyadic identities are activated. importantly, the bias created by the\\ngroup context also changes the meaning of propositions 5–8, which\\nnow are based on a leadership perception process involving group as\\nwell as dyadic properties. therefore, when leadership emerges to a\\ncollective phenomenon, the bias operates at each dyadic level, as a\\nfunction of the solidified collective outcome.\\n\\nfinally, to fully represent how the leadership emergence process\\noccurs over time, it is crucial to incorporate the idea of entropy in\\ndynamical systems. according to general systems theory, entropy re-\\npresents the degree of disorder within a dynamic system (skyttner,\\n2005). within the realm of psychology, hirsh et al. (2012) describe\\nentropy as great uncertainty about “which state currently defines a\\nsystem” (p. 305). we argue that this accurately represents the process of\\nleadership emergence where high entropy would occur in a system\\nwhere individuals did not differentiate between who they expected to\\nperform a leadership role at a given moment, and the leadership per-\\nceptions of one person towards each member of the group would be\\nrelatively equal across all individuals; that is for all group members as\\nperceived by that one individual.\\n\\nentropy will increase in proportion to the number of competing\\npossibilities that must be selected from. low entropy levels are re-\\npresented by tight distributions, where one outcome is much more\\nprobable to occur compared to other outcomes, whereas high entropy\\nlevels are represented by flat probability distributions where any out-\\ncome is close in likelihood for all outcomes (hirsh et al., 2012). we\\nrepresent entropy in terms of collective leadership identities to capture\\na schematic understanding that reflects the combined individual,\\ndyadic, and collective levels; and we use identity rather than behavior\\nor self-schema to represent a deeper, contextualized understanding of\\nthe self rather than moment to moment variation in surface-level, task-\\nrelated behaviors.\\n\\nthe relative entropy is a function of the relative probability each\\nindividual will activate a leader identity at a certain time. if many in-\\ndividuals have a high probability of leadership identity activation, the\\ncollective will have high levels of leadership entropy (see fig. 2 for\\nillustration). this represents the level of entropy within a collective at\\none point in time. thus, a critical component of non-linear dynamical\\n\\nsystems is that they are expected to shift in levels of entropy over time\\n(prigogine, 1978). furthermore, these changes in entropy represent\\nimportant structural changes for emergent properties (hirsh et al.,\\n2012). regarding the leadership emergence process, if the collective\\nhas low entropy at a particular time, this would mean that there was a\\nclear collective understanding of who is the leader within that specific\\nevent. however, if over time, the members of the collective begin to\\nrealize that this individual was not fulfilling group objectives (external\\ntension), this may cause members to experiment with new leadership\\nroles. if this occurred, the level of both uncertainty and entropy would\\nincrease within the collective. however, if the collective then finds a\\nnew structure of leadership that can resolve these external tensions,\\nthey will adopt this new attractor state with perhaps different persons\\nidentifying as the group leaders; thus, entropy levels will decrease once\\nthis new attractor state is reached.\\n\\nfinally, this theorizing about the collective changes in leadership\\nover time aligns closely with the review findings regarding principle 3.\\nspecifically, in reviewing previous works that theorize or test the post-\\nemergent dynamics of leadership, works focused at the collective level\\ndescribed important changes occurring over time in the collective lea-\\ndership structure. as illustrated in table 3, while early works studying\\nthe nomination of individuals has found that leadership can demonstrate\\nstability over time if the task environment does not change, works on\\nteams and networks has found that the collective continues to de-\\nmonstrate significant changes in the leadership structure (klein,\\nziegert, knight, & xiao, 2006). furthermore, as these changes are a\\nfunction of multiple dynamic inputs, the form of change is expected to\\nbe non-linear, with different elements affecting the collective structure\\nat different points in the groups life cycle (uhl-bien et al., 2007).\\n\\nto summarize, we argue that leadership emergence is represented\\nby a dynamic multi-level process, starting with deep structure elements\\nof self-schema activation and translating into contextualized identities\\nas function of social feedback. the fundamental mechanism is a double-\\ninteract in which each party both perceives the other and activates a\\nself-identity that is consistent with this perception, and when these\\nprocesses align over the group, entropy is low and a stable group-level\\nattractor also exists. this collective leadership structure continues to\\nadapt to a dynamic environment. however, the emergent structure is\\nformed by the interaction of each individual's deep-level social cogni-\\ntive processes, which drive the sensegiving and sensemaking mechan-\\nisms of leadership emergence.\\n\\nin developing this conceptual framework describing the leadership\\nemergence process, we believe that we have made six primary con-\\ntributions. first, this framework captures how the emergence process\\ncan develop at individual, dyadic, and group levels, either sequentially\\nor simultaneously. second, we have specified key variables based on an\\nextensive and careful review of the literature that capture both deep\\nand surface level structures. third, we have translated processes into\\npropositions which can guide future empirical estimation and reflect\\nthe dynamics of leadership structure emergence on both an in-\\ntrapersonal and interpersonal basis. fourth, the overall framework is\\nindexed by time to reflect its dynamic nature and facilitate future works\\nwhich aim to incorporate a temporal component that address changes\\nover time. fifth, we have focused on the link between leadership and\\nidentity because identity is a powerful schema that guides behavior,\\nskill acquisition, motivation, and social perceptions. in other terms, we\\nhave taken a deep-structure approach to understanding dynamic\\nemergent processes. this provides an important complement to the\\nprevious works that have approached emergence from a multilevel\\nperspective, while focusing on the interactions among individuals\\nwhich reflect the deep level processes our framework introduces (e.g.\\nderue, 2011). finally, we have also grounded the process in theories of\\nleadership perception at an individual level and uncertainty or entropy\\nat the group level (i.e. bridging levels). together these six contributions\\nadvance our understanding of leadership emergence and provide a basis\\nto further develop process approaches.\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n159\\n\\n\\n\\navenues for future research\\n\\nin the previous sections, we reviewed the extant literature and de-\\nveloped a framework to articulate the basic elemental content of what\\nis exchanged and the process mechanisms describing how it is ex-\\nchanged, resulting in the emergence of leadership. as noted by\\nkozlowski (2015), this type of emergent framework delves into the\\ndeep details, where leadership emergence is not a “box” in a model\\n(kozlowski & chao, 2012). rather, “it is a specification of the actual\\npsychological and/or behavioral action at the lowest level of analysis\\nthat contribute to the emergence of the phenomenon” (p. 16). as our\\nframework focuses on delineating the underlying mechanisms of the\\nleadership emergence process, we propose that future research imple-\\nment two types of computational modeling to further develop and ul-\\ntimately test our framework: agent-based modeling (abm) and equa-\\ntion-based modeling (ebm). however, it is important to establish that\\nour process oriented framework represents narrative theory that can\\nonly be used to assist in the larger process of formulating a computa-\\ntional model; it is not intended to be directly translated into either type\\nof computation modeling. therefore, in explaining the unique benefits\\nof both abm and ebm (parunak, savit, & riolo, 1998) we note where\\nthe current paper leaves off, and where future work would serve to\\ncontinue the development of modeling tools which study the leadership\\nemergence process.\\n\\nas abm can be used to test the rules that lower level “agents” (e.g.\\npersons) follow when forming a higher-level unit (bonabeau, 2002), we\\nargue that it can be used to simulate the enacted processes of our fra-\\nmework in a dynamic fashion. castillo and trinh (2018) provide a\\ndetailed explication of the benefits and uses of abm to study leadership.\\nin order to develop an abm of the leadership emergence process, spe-\\ncific assumptions would have to be stipulated regarding the rules that\\nagents follow within the system. the current paper represents what\\nkozlowski et al. (2013) and grand et al. (2016) would describe as step\\n1 of a larger process, which they define as “a narrative theory of what\\nindividuals do, think, feel, that gives rise to a higher level outcome.”\\n(grand et al., 2016, p. 1354). accordingly, to develop an associated\\nagent based model, this process requires the next step of translating this\\nnarrative theory into a series of if-then statements which outline how\\neach agent would behave within the overall system. for example, in\\nfollowing the model developed in grand et al. (2016), our current\\nframework would likely be separated into two categories of statements:\\none related to leader/follower actions, and one related to leader/fol-\\nlower perceptions. subsequently, individual statements could be in-\\ntroduced such as: if an agent's leader self-schema is greater than their\\nfollower self-schema, then they perform a leadership behavior. finally, it is\\nnecessary to include a series of group-level statements, which stipulate\\nthe process by which the group reaches consensus (i.e. leadership has\\nemerged), and the simulation ends.\\n\\nadditionally, as ebm has been effectively used to simulate the\\ncomplex intra-individual motivational and self-related processes within\\norganizational phenomena (vancouver & weinhardt, 2010; vancouver\\n& weinhardt, 2012), we argue that ebm can be uniquely used to si-\\nmulate the deep-level mechanisms driving the surface level interactions\\nto which our framework emphasizes. specifically, vancouver and\\n\\nweinhardt (2012) argue that ebm—using a system dynamics per-\\nspective—is a preferred  for testing phenomena at the “intra-\\nagent” level, which is a level that our framework specifically targets\\n(i.e. cognitive processes). however, in the previous works that im-\\nplemented these types for modeling procedures, it is critical to note the\\ncurrent paper is not sufficient to develop this type of model. instead,\\nebm requires the development of formal mathematical expressions\\nwhich are used to represent the system of interest. unlike the protocol\\nfor developing an abm simulation, the ebm protocol using a system\\ndynamics perspective would involve first defining the key variables in\\nthe system, then specifying the mathematical relations among these\\nvariables (vancouver & weinhardt, 2012). it should also be noted that\\nfor both abm and ebm, the appropriate temporal frame would have to\\nbe defined in order for the model to be performed. as the current fra-\\nmework provides single level propositions which define the critical\\nvariables in the leadership emergence system, it may align more closely\\nwith the development of an ebm model using a system dynamics per-\\nspective. however, we formed the propositions such that future works\\ncould use the current paper for the development of formal models\\nwhich then could be adapted to either form of computational modeling.\\nin doing so, we believe that abm and ebm can offer unique and com-\\nplementary benefits for studying both the deep-level and surface-level\\ncomponents in our overall leadership emergence framework.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nin this article, we developed a framework that emphasizes the im-\\nportance of a multilevel process to understand leadership emergence.\\nalthough the framework's underlying structure was designed to include\\nthe most fundamental processes of leadership emergence, we view our\\nframework as a starting point for future research to continue unpacking\\nthe dynamics of leadership emergence. as our mapping process cannot\\nempirically evaluate the underlying process mechanisms in leadership\\nemergence, we hope that future works can build off our framework by\\nstatistically evaluating the relative importance of process mechanisms\\nusing techniques such as computational modeling (poile & safayeni,\\n2016). in addition, by focusing our literature search on psychology and\\nmanagement areas, we may have excluded theory and research on\\nemergent leadership in other domains such as education.\\n\\nfinally, it's important to note that in our process-oriented frame-\\nwork, we did not incorporate the full dynamic nature of context.\\nspecifically, it is well established that the bottom-up processes of\\nemergence and the top-down processes of context are related in a dy-\\nnamic and reciprocal fashion (kozlowski, chao, grand, braun, &\\nkuljanin, 2016). furthermore, the leadership emergence process is now\\nunderstood to be embedded within greater social networks (carter\\net al., 2015). for example, leadership is both embedded with informal\\nsocial networks (e.g. advice networks), as well as formal hierarchical\\norganizational structures (e.g. formal leaders). the current paper did\\nnot intend to address these exogenous contextual effects, but rather to\\naddress carter and colleagues' call for “research that identifies the en-\\ndogenous rules or principles governing leadership emergence” (carter\\net al., 2015, p. 614). finally, although contextual effects are not directly\\nincorporated into our framework, top-down constraints are indirectly\\n\\nfig. 2. illustration of differing levels of leadership entropy in the collective leadership identity (li) activation process.\\n\\nb.p. acton et al. the leadership quarterly 30 (2019) 145–164\\n\\n160\\n\\n\\n\\nreflected by the incorporation of contextual adjustments in leadership\\nprototypes (foti et al., 2008; lord et al., 2001; sy et al., 2010).\\n\\nconclusions\\n\\nour review shows the diversity of approaches in the area of lea-\\ndership emergence. although this diversity has brought forth novel\\nperspectives that enrich our knowledge of leadership emergence, it also\\npresents several challenges that future research must address. notably,\\nin our framework, we have incorporated and integrated process me-\\nchanisms from the micro-level perspectives (cf., self-schema and iden-\\ntity) to the macro level (cf., complexity theory). we have argued that\\nattention to these dynamic processes as they unfold over time and\\nacross different levels of analysis is critical because it helps capture the\\ncomplexity that defines real individual, group, and organizational sys-\\ntems. therefore, efforts to advance leadership theory and research will\\nrequire that we pay attention to the processes that underlie these\\nphenomena as they occur at multiple levels of analysis. these levels\\nexist both across social units and within individuals as we move from\\nsurface structures emphasizing behaviors to underlying identity struc-\\ntures. by developing a framework that focuses on the process of lea-\\ndership emergence involving both leadership and identities, we help\\nbridge a disconnect between leadership emergence and its associated\\nprocesses (dinh et al., 2014), thus paving the way for a major ad-\\nvancement within the field of leadership.\\n\\nwe close with a quote from hunt and dodge (2000) who wrote, “to\\nknow where we are going with leadership research, we must know\\nwhere we are, and where we have been—we must look backward and\\nforward at the same time” (p. 453). as has been noted multiple times in\\nthe past, the idea of informal leadership processes being distinct from\\ntheir associated outcomes is not a new idea. nevertheless, as our review\\nindicated, it seems that the field has largely forgotten about the pro-\\ngress made 60 years ago in the study of leadership processes. emer-\\ngence theory describes processes that are dynamic, integrating re-\\nlationship across all moments in time. in other words, the past\\ninfluences the future and the future influences the past. we hope that\\nour review, highlights this progress and creates a basis for further ad-\\nvancement.\\n\\nacknowledgments\\n\\nwe would like to thank the anonymous reviewer and david day for\\ntheir valuable comments and suggestions that improved the quality of\\nthe paper. we also thank erika hernandez for her comments on an\\nearlier version of this article.\\n\""

emergence which aims address three major objectives.first central component emergent process multilevel nature kozlowski incorporate three levels individual relational collective leadership emergence into theoretical framework.although previous theories have discussed informal leadership processes across multiple levels derue ashford review indicated that previous theories tended focus these levels rather than incorporate levels derue being notable exception this tendency reflects trends found leadership literature whole batistič černe vogel .accordingly theoretical framework include

emergence.second emergent properties defined mechanisms that drive bottom process kozlowski structure theoretical framework incorporate most frequently occurring process mechanisms identified review starting individual level.from doing identify fundamental mechanisms leadership emergence self structures enacted structures. elaborate these specific categories following section. format framework follows. first introduce categories self structures enacted structures which used describe fundamental mechanisms emergence process.next describe emergence process occurs across levels over time.across these three levels describe process first terms role self structural properties followed role enacted structural properties system. incorporate most common process mechanisms theories each level found review.finally developing process oriented framework introduce propositions that could used guide future empirical estimation development testable formal models grand vancouver weinhardt schmidt examples . begin this process providing specific propositions that represent emergence process each level.these propositions listed table .fundamental mechanisms describing basic nature organizations weick stated that they made interlocked behaviors that embedded conditionally related processes . .this reflects findings literature review papers described emergence process principle using mechanisms either behaviors subsequent interactions occurring across individuals deeper level self information processes occurring within individuals which reflect their ongoing interactions table .specifically labeled these categories leadership emergence mechanisms self structures enacted structures.self structures refer cognitions related individuals produce process understand

construction process between leaders followers weick . believe self schemas self identities reflect deep structure leadership emergence because they fundamental input into self regulation lord brown markus wurf self regulation turn produces adaptive behaviors kanfer frese johnson which view surface structure indication leadership emergence.according lord gatti chui sensemaking perspective helps move beyond static view leadership individuals richer understanding leadership socially constructed process that situationally embedded occurs across multiple levels over time. example ashforth schinoff emphasize situational embeddedness social construction identities being part sensemaking process.thus using organizational sensemaking literature organize results from literature review previous theories describing separate processes occurring different levels integrated into complete bottom representation leadership emergence process that relates table continued element category

describing organizational sensemaking continued develop idea organizational sensegiving added represent complementary process sensemaking. argue that both sensemaking sensegiving central processes necessary understand leadership emergence process.sensemaking represents process which individuals perceive ultimately organize complex information into coherent narrative weick sutcliffe obstfeld narrative they construct often reflects their personal identity work ibarra barbulescu . contrast sensegiving represents process which constructed meaning conveyed others hill levenhagen this also reflected stories from which authentic leadership inferred others shamir eilam .sensegiving becomes particularly important within collective leadership context where each individual enacted unique understanding leadership followership. sensegiving concerns individuals influence others into adapting their definition organization reality gioia chittipeddi incorporate both sensegiving sensemaking into enacted structure portion theoretical framework describing process which individuals develop shared reality leadership.finally although both sensemaking sensegiving help individual construct their individual meaning within collective .self processes both viewed social activities maitlis that individuals action construct both self understandings sensemaking well shape understandings others sensegiving .therefore while sensegiving sensemaking inform both self structures enacted structures they occur within processes related enacted structures.throughout explication process oriented theoretical framework leadership emergence table intended serve visual representation.this table illustrates specific self structural changes enacted structural changes that occur hypothetical four person group .this table also intended represent progression from individual relational collective levels.individual level self structures largest portion theories individual level discussed role self views self schema self identity emery daniloski hamby hall lord lord brown freiberg .according these perspectives individuals proceed both leaders followers within collective largely function they view themselves leader within given domain hannah woolfolk lord .according this view individuals have expectations leadership prior interacting with others.work leader follower identity suggests that individuals specifically rely self schemas which cognitive structures that shape affective cognitive behavioral responses individuals each context lord markus wurf .self schemas domain specific .leadership domain they serve help individuals retrieve necessary information adapt changing goals within given social context cross markus .therefore some individuals will have self schema leadership these self schemas will guide both their perceptions others their behavioral responses within leadership context. critical understanding about self schemas that they activated specific situational cues primes lord .therefore depending particular social context people will shift between leader follower schemas .only will activated particular moment . example person working with someone higher social status they activate follower self schema while they activate leader self schema when interacting with someone lower status epitropaki kark mainemelis lord .withinta . . .acton . leadership quarterly context informal collectives leadership self schemas likely activated function both task environment other individuals within collective .social situation . addition previous research demonstrated that there will meaningful between person variability strength self schema within given domain depending prior experience individuals.according markus strength self schema indicated extent that individuals process information about self given domain with relative ease retrieve behavioral evidence from domain predict their future behavior domain resist counter schematic information about themselves.individuals that have well developed leadership selfschema would high these factors would viewed schematic leadership domain lord .this point critical research shows that relative strength leadership selfschemas meaningfully impacts whether people will adopt leadership roles smith brown lord engle produce leadership behaviors johnson .accordingly argue that individuals with more developed leadership self schema related given context will more likely enact leadership role early leadership emergence process.finally adopting recent process approaches leader identity lord further understanding generated about role self structures leadership emergence process differentiating them from self identities.specifically although previous works discuss leader follower identity critical self structures emergence process .emery more recent works suggest that leader identities develop until individual leadership self schema becomes contextualized into ongoing social processes within collective epitropaki lord lord chui . this conscious situated identity constructed each person uses their previous experience self schema salient values enact identity that socially

development involves deeper structure than leadership claims social grants leadership discussed derue ashford .constructing situated identities area including leadership complex self regulatory process that engages many selfmotives involves affect cognitive processes involves crafting self narrative that will socially accepted.interestingly individuals have dedicated neural structures called default networks grounding self task social historical contexts raichle . representing role self structures early leadership emergence process important incorporate factors that will impact activation specific leader self schema within context.although concepts such gender central self concept most individuals therefore chronically available markus crane bernstein siladi leader self schemas presumed chronically available instead activated function additional factors lord .first previously described leader follower schema activation will function both task other individuals collective what label social situation. clear these informal adhoc groups this point emergence process other informal relational structures have developed .friendship network carter .thus schema activation

ambady .these cues .race others task requirements make social context variable described what labeled discrete task social factors.second research suggests that activation particular self schemas impacted whether individuals motivated process self related information bober grolnick . example within leadership context individuals that more committed collective organizational goals more likely activate appropriate leadership self schemas lord .this individuallevel cognitive structure differ among group members reflecting dynamic group level leadership structure mental model point will return later.based above rationale turn first step developing specific propositions which represent aspects micro processes associated with leadership emergence.although various propositions operate holistically reflect dynamics complex system they necessarily must developed individually.thus while multiple individuals emerge simultaneously within collective start focusing individuals. begin representing process leadership self schema activation person specific time point using following proposition.proposition . activation leadership self schema particular point time will depend context

kozlowski watola jensen botero .stein heller stated that development task leadership roles major thesis emergent leadership theories . .consequently argue that performance these acts critical component sensegiving process within leadership emergence table .weick notion enacted sensemaking represents this stage emergence process. studying individual behaviors change over leadership emergence process research found that early emergence process people focus solely task requirements whereas later they change their behaviors based original actions perceived others within collective strickland .this supports claim that early stage emergence process individuals performing actions based their prior experiences within that context social confirmation denial others.thus initially amount type leadership acts performed individuals expected largely function their leadership self schema.specifically argue that probability leader behavior particular person time depends both leader follower selfschemas.proposition . probability that individual will perform leadership behavior specific time will based whether activation their leader self schema greater than their follower selfschema that time.although expositional purposes propositions represent these social processes developing past individual level relational group contexts part situation that activates leader follower schemas.subsequently reflected appraisal processes will play critical role relational level emergence process lord brown .further social processes involved constructing situated identities emerge through series actions that play over time derue involve resolution ambiguity regarding oneself given situation ashforth schinoff .this could represented cumulating more precisely integrating propositions over given time period.relational level self structure relational level many theories literature review describe emergence process using leaders adjustment expectations followers additionally other works focused negotiation leader follower identities among members collective derue derue ashford marchiondo . terms self these works describe leadership emergence process mutual identity construction occurring across individuals with differing expectations leadership.once emergence process reaches relational level expectation that individuals have begun incorporate social feedback forming socially constructed leader identity thus argue that formation socially embedded leader identity serves evidence that emergence process begun emphasize relational level.this discrete transition gradual shift emphasis that merges intra individual with inter individual identity processes. critical change that occurs moving from individual relational level that individual leader self identity increasingly important social component. example derue ashford model claiming granting whether individual claim leadership granted others within collective critical determining whether they will maintain leader identity.however there ambiguity regarding such processes. example whether individual actions with leadership prototype matter degree nothing process lord rosch lloyd different individuals hold different leadership prototypes creating ambiguity they interpret respond group activities. combining these works with works followership self schemas lord argue that deeper level this process social confirmation driven part selfschemas followers.specifically actions leader activate follower self schema others then leader identity prospective leader socially confirmed shondrick lord .furthermore other works categorized relational level describe important role followers implicit leadership theory ocker huang benbunan fich hiltz schema activation process.importantly what occurring over time creation relation among actors perceivers that involves bidirectional effects identity activation both parties social exchange.typically relations stabilize creating attractor double interact that depends active identities both parties.this represented propositions which although developed separately operate system that evolves over time. basic level implicit leader theories refer follower prototypes leaders within given context lord foti vader .according this work individual more likely perceive someone else leader prospective leader behaviors coincide with follower expectations leadership forsyth .taken together process leadership emergence argue that there match between characteristics behaviors prospective leader leadership prototype perceivers then they will apply category leader social target depending goodness their .finally important note that this process occurring within each dyad signifying that this dyadic process occurring across multiple individuals simultaneously within overall collective.based this rationale represent extent leadership perception towards perspective leader perspective follower match between prospective leader characteristics prospective follower .proposition . leadership perception specific individual specific time will based match between perceiver prospective leader perceived characteristics.enacted structure however leadership perception passive directional process.perceiving another leader implications perceiver well actor likely partially activate corresponding follower self schema. confirmation prospective leader self identity ultimately involves activation compatible roles that make sense each party identity this situation give sense other party. other words underlying double interact terms surface behaviors related claiming granting deeper double interact that reflects meaning mutually reinforcing identities.further this meaning discovered both parties enacted over time.this idea reflected sluss ashforth discussion relational identities encompassing both self identities role based identities .follower .thus relational level individuals begin simply because self schemas also based whether others perceive respond them leader that time. relational level many theories discussed enactment leadership emergence through variation what weick referred double interacts .according these works derue marchiondo interacts occur when .acton . leadership quarterly behavior individual becomes contingent upon behavior another within system.leadership basic nature represents interpersonal influence kaiser hogan craig double interacts viewed basic unit describing interpersonal influence weick . .according weick double interacts serve precursor collective understandings because individuals justify their interactions using collective explanation. example within leadership context person reflecting their interactions with person they could explanation that person leader within group that interacted with them that .thus these interacts help inform each person understanding leadership within collective.alternatively individuals think explicitly about such roles rather respond implicitly leader follower identities constructed over time through enactive processes.whether constructed implicitly explicitly affectively cognitively identities developed through double interacts reflect attractors that make sense past guide future interacts.thereby patterning leader follower interactions takes place derue .according shondrick lord social construction leadership occurs when potential leader perceives infers group individuals followers when individuals group begin view themselves being that prospective leader. through these interacts that individuals begin rely both active self schemas situated provisional identities well perceptions reactions others.thus previously argued relational stage individuals begin transition from leader follower self schemas leader follower identities their self schemas become socially confirmed through double interacts.specifically dyadic level probability that single person will have leadership identity will function their activation leadership self schema addition leadership perception prospective follower.furthermore probability that person will activate follower identity will function their followership selfschema addition whether they perceive other person leader.finally self schema activation incorporates self perceptions within that given domain markus wurf represent probability activating leader follower identities propositions respectively. important note that proposition includes component pertaining leaders another pertaining followers thus reflecting mutual dependence double interact.proposition reflects self schema activation prospective follower well their perceptions their dyadic partner which internal representation double interact held this prospective follower.together propositions defined level that integrates self identity with both activation internal knowledge structures that self schemas leadership perception process.proposition . probability that leader identity activated person depends that person activation their leadership self schema their dyadic partner leadership perception them that time.proposition . probability that follower identity activated person depends that person activation their followership self schema their perception that their dyadic partner leader that time.these interacts represent micro elements process which leaders followers negotiate their individualized internal representations leadership .leadership self structures .these elements static indexing time implies they evolve over time leadership perceptions proposition . important recognize that follower self schemas have many positive attributes such being productive going above beyond being team player that part leadership processes well.though initially have been guided follower schema individuals excel these factors perceived others exhibiting leadership communication these social perceptions part process that activates leadership schemas. other words leadership times recognized others before being recognized oneself alvesson sveningsson paunova .this mutual form enactment further represented phenomenon synchronization which fundamental component dynamical systems blasius huppert stone .synchronization represents process which separate systems coupled within same environment demonstrate identical compatible dynamics over time rulkov sushchik tsimring abarbanel . classic example synchronization fact that metronomes operating different tempos will synchronize same tempo when placed common base pantaleone .jiang . found that leaderfollower relationships were characterized neural synchronization that occurred over time.specifically they measured communication frequency neural synchronization groups performing leaderless group problem solving task found that quality communication predicted neural synchronization emergent leader follower relationships.this critical during process sensemaking double interacts enable individuals develop shared understandings social environment weick .thus argue that these leader follower interactions form synchrony behavior over time which begins manifest stable leader follower relationships that grounded situated identities well formation shared internal representations leadership within collective self structure . this point emergence process leadership have fully emerged these double interacts developed into stable pattern interactions.weick argues that these interacts cannot viewed stable until both leaders actions become predictable followers subsequent actions become predictable weick . other words perceptions both leader follower cross thresholds both individuals become mutually interdependent. believe that once these requirements leader follower identities begin solidify stable leader follower relationships formed.over time represent relational processes leadership emergence individuals performing actions function their self schema proposition well past acts have been confirmed which argue direct function leadership perceptions prospective followers.therefore through this confirmation process driven leadership perceptions self schema activation stable leader follower identities begin form rolebased attractors dynamic dyadic system these attractors guide subsequent dyadic social interactions. interactions reflect only surface structure that supported deeper emergences synchronized identities specified propositions . should stress that expositional convenience have depicted these micro elements structure relational level being independent collective level. relax that assumption discuss leadership identity structures collective level.collective level self structure common collective process mechanism found papers from literature review social identification .most these papers specifically included social identity theory leadership hogg .this theory builds from relational level describing individuals begin view leadership terms specific group prototypes rather than their individualized leader prototypes reicher haslam hopkins . this point emergence process individual emerge group leader enough their behavior activate follower self schemas others addition emergence begins occur once prospective leader actions group leadership prototype knippenberg knippenberg .acton . leadership quarterly cremer hogg .accordingly collective level once patterning interactions results followers contextualizing their follower schemas into stable follower identity this advances emergence process.furthermore followers develop follower identity context single prospective leader actions then that individual likely exemplifying leadership group prototype shared cognitive representation that collective leadership reicher . collective level process social identification represents critical identity work that underlies emergence process.according knippenberg social identification represents process which interests group become central each individual self identity.thus over emergence process through social identification individuals expected shift from viewing leadership through their leadership self schemas viewing leadership through lens their group.this process gradual automatic connectionist systems that support categorization processes incorporate group context into contextualized implicit leadership theories lord brown harvey . primary motivational driver this process uncertainty reduction hogg .according this perspective viewing leadership differently than others within collective creates uncertainty about future. individuals seek predict control their social world leotti iyengar ochsner this uncertainty leads internal tensions which provokes anxiety stress hogg .thus reduce negative effects uncertainty individuals incorporate collective understanding leadership. each group member begins identify with collective level their potential leader follower identity becomes function both their leader follower dyadic self identities well collective leadership perceptions others within group.that probability that they will have leader identity collective level becomes function both their leader self identities well collective leadership perceptions that others group have them.additionally probability that individual will activate follower identity will function their follower self schema well whether they others perceive someone else perspective leader that time. represent this process propositions which include aggregation across group members dyadic level leadership perceptions reflect collective leadership identity person specific time point.proposition . collective level probability that person leader identity activated depends both their individual leadership self schema activation well leadership perceptions others towards them.proposition . collective level probability that person follower identity activated depends both their individual followership self schema activation well followership perceptions others towards them.propositions represent independent aggregation across dyads what been labeled compositional aggregation dinh kozlowski klein lord hannah jennings . however processes underlying dyadic identity formation interact form construct collective level which next paragraph maintain likely then collective leadership identities should qualitatively different than dyadic leader identities process that would termed compilational aggregation.compilational aggregation would also require adding component which reflects interdependence dyadic processes which addressed following section enacted structures. connecting individual level schemas formation collective identities social identification represents meso process whereby individuals transition from external categorization internal identification.according social identity theory tajfel turner social categorization externally oriented concerns others social identification internally oriented concerns self jenkins . argue that this distinction critical understanding process leadership emergence because interpretation leadership changes orientations process crosses levels.specifically lower levels individuals view their interactions with others within collective external their self concept.however process social identification occurs each person expected think about these collective interactions internally reference themselves. argue that shift from external categorization internal categorization begins capture when leadership emerged .collective structure formed .further when emergent leader identifies with group embodies group prototype self schema becomes more consistent with group level cognitive structure.enacted structure collective level other common process mechanisms were collective patterning interaction tension reduction .furthermore these mechanisms were primarily discussed papers that used complexity perspectives .lichtenstein bien .according these works emergence process represented patterning leader follower interactions over time.however complexity approaches beyond leader follower interactions discussing collective mechanisms that operate group level drive emergence process. major mechanism group level idea tension reduction that patterns leader follower interactions serve adaptively reduce tension ultimately reach collective goals hazy .this reflects idea collective identity individuals seek resolve internal tension uncertainty experienced when competing conceptions leadership occur hogg . addition internal tension uncertainty tension caused having adapt external environment viewed primary external tension within leadership emergence process schneider somers . illustrate both these internal external tensions drive leadership emergence process pair complexity theory with other linear dynamical systems neural networks hopfield spin glass structures stein newman .according theory hopfield networks over time collective neurons explore different patterns activation reach minimum amount energy required produce outcome hopfield .regarding emergence process argue that this represents external tensions collective must perform specific pattern leader follower interactions meet environmental requirements.consequently argue that over time collective will enact specific patterns double interacts between leaders followers until most efficient pattern found. extend idea neural networks internal tensions that drive leadership emergence helps incorporate concept spin glass structures common phenomenon used complexity theory stein newman .spin glasses disordered magnetic materials which contain elements polarity .positive negative state .through local interaction each unit with adjacent units specific atoms within structure move from disorder coherent global pattern.thus structure resolves internal tension caused disequilibrium across atoms moving global state equilibrium. only this transition equilibrium fundamental spin glass structures this central tenet complexity leadership perspectives schneider somers .accordingly argue that just individual atoms within spin glass structure change positions align with other atoms structure terms have developed create double interacts through series interacts weick dyads shift their structure align with other dyads collective. example group four people leader follower relationship will more likely develop .acton . leadership quarterly follower relationship .that double interact tends flip double interact this happens throughout group stable leadership structure emerges.furthermore this alignment collective reduces internal tensions driven uncertainty hogg . reflect this between dyad interaction would modify proposition which involves match leader characteristics follower form proposition which takes into account this group context introducing bias component that reflects this effect other dyadic relations group. assume that biases involving different pairs dyads encountered over time attention shifts from dyadic comparison another.proposition . collective leadership perception towards individual group time depends match prospective leader characteristics each group member well additional biasing effect other dyadic leadership relations group.proposition thus translates dyadic process into group context reflects what klein dansereau hall have termed parts within wholes relationship. arguing then that group context changes dyadic leadership perceptions function through this biasing function that operates sequentially particular dyad compared other dyads .over time this comparison introduce variability into perceived eventually this variability will reduced more uniform structure evolves there shared perceptions person group members . this point group level attractor exists biasing function becomes uniform across possible pairs dyads reflecting evolved common understanding group context. other words group well dyadic identities activated.importantly bias created group context also changes meaning propositions which based leadership perception process involving group well dyadic properties.therefore when leadership emerges collective phenomenon bias operates each dyadic level function solidified collective outcome.finally fully represent leadership emergence process occurs over time crucial incorporate idea entropy dynamical systems.according general systems theory entropy represents degree disorder within dynamic system skyttner .within realm psychology hirsh . describe entropy great uncertainty about which state currently defines system . . argue that this accurately represents process leadership emergence where high entropy would occur system where individuals differentiate between they expected perform leadership role given moment leadership perceptions person towards each member group would relatively equal across individuals that group members perceived that individual.entropy will increase proportion number competing possibilities that must selected from. entropy levels represented tight distributions where outcome much more probable occur compared other outcomes whereas high entropy levels represented flat probability distributions where outcome close likelihood outcomes hirsh . represent entropy terms collective leadership identities capture schematic understanding that reflects combined individual dyadic collective levels identity rather than behavior self schema represent deeper contextualized understanding self rather than moment moment variation surface level taskrelated behaviors. relative entropy function relative probability each individual will activate leader identity certain time. many individuals have high probability leadership identity activation collective will have high levels leadership entropy . illustration .this represents level entropy within collective point time.thus critical component linear dynamical systems that they expected shift levels entropy over time prigogine .furthermore these changes entropy represent important structural changes emergent properties hirsh .regarding leadership emergence process collective entropy particular time this would mean that there clear collective understanding leader within that specific event.however over time members collective begin realize that this individual fulfilling group objectives external tension this cause members experiment with leadership roles. this occurred level both uncertainty entropy would increase within collective.however collective then finds structure leadership that resolve these external tensions they will adopt this attractor state with perhaps different persons identifying group leaders thus entropy levels will decrease once this attractor state reached.finally this theorizing about collective changes leadership over time aligns closely with review findings regarding principle .specifically reviewing previous works that theorize test postemergent dynamics leadership works focused collective level described important changes occurring over time collective leadership structure. illustrated table while early works studying nomination individuals found that leadership demonstrate stability over time task environment does change works teams networks found that collective continues demonstrate significant changes leadership structure klein ziegert knight xiao .furthermore these changes function multiple dynamic inputs form change expected linear with different elements affecting collective structure different points groups life cycle bien . summarize argue that leadership emergence represented dynamic multi level process starting with deep structure elements self schema activation translating into contextualized identities function social feedback. fundamental mechanism doubleinteract which each party both perceives other activates self identity that consistent with this perception when these processes align over group entropy stable group level attractor also exists.this collective leadership structure continues adapt dynamic environment.however emergent structure formed interaction each individual deep level social cognitive processes which drive sensegiving sensemaking mechanisms leadership emergence. developing this conceptual framework describing leadership emergence process believe that have made primary contributions.first this framework captures emergence process develop individual dyadic group levels either sequentially simultaneously.second have specified variables based extensive careful review literature that capture both deep surface level structures.third have translated processes into propositions which guide future empirical estimation reflect dynamics leadership structure emergence both intrapersonal interpersonal basis.fourth overall framework indexed time reflect dynamic nature facilitate future works which incorporate temporal component that address changes over time.fifth have focused link between leadership identity because identity powerful schema that guides behavior skill acquisition motivation social perceptions. other terms have taken deep structure approach understanding dynamic emergent processes.this provides important complement previous works that have approached emergence from multilevel perspective while focusing interactions among individuals which reflect deep level processes framework introduces .derue .finally have also grounded process theories leadership perception individual level uncertainty entropy group level .bridging levels .together these contributions advance understanding leadership emergence provide basis further develop process approaches. .acton . leadership quarterly avenues future research previous sections reviewed extant literature developed framework articulate basic elemental content what exchanged process mechanisms describing exchanged resulting emergence leadership. noted kozlowski this type emergent framework delves into deep details where leadership emergence model kozlowski chao .rather specification actual psychological behavioral action lowest level analysis that contribute emergence phenomenon . . framework focuses delineating underlying mechanisms leadership emergence process propose that future research implement types computational modeling further develop ultimately test framework agent based modeling equation based modeling .however important establish that process oriented framework represents narrative theory that only used assist larger process formulating computational model intended directly translated into either type computation modeling.therefore explaining unique benefits both parunak savit riolo note where current paper leaves where future work would serve continue development modeling tools which study leadership emergence process. used test rules that lower level agents .persons follow when forming higher level unit bonabeau argue that used simulate enacted processes framework dynamic fashion.castillo trinh provide detailed explication benefits uses study leadership. order develop leadership emergence process specific assumptions would have stipulated regarding rules that agents follow within system. current paper represents what kozlowski . grand . would describe step larger process which they define narrative theory what individuals think feel that gives rise higher level outcome. grand . .accordingly develop associated agent based model this process requires next step translating this narrative theory into series then statements which outline each agent would behave within overall system. example following model developed grand . current framework would likely separated into categories statements related leader follower actions related leader follower perceptions.subsequently individual statements could introduced such agent leader self schema greater than their follower self schema then they perform leadership behavior.finally necessary include series group level statements which stipulate process which group reaches consensus .leadership emerged simulation ends.additionally been effectively used simulate complex intra individual motivational self related processes within organizational phenomena vancouver weinhardt vancouver weinhardt argue that uniquely used simulate deep level mechanisms driving surface level interactions which framework emphasizes.specifically vancouver weinhardt argue that using system dynamics perspective preferred testing phenomena intraagent level which level that framework specifically targets .cognitive processes .however previous works that implemented these types modeling procedures critical note current paper sufficient develop this type model.instead requires development formal mathematical expressions which used represent system interest.unlike protocol developing simulation protocol using system dynamics perspective would involve first defining variables system then specifying mathematical relations among these variables vancouver weinhardt . should also noted that both appropriate temporal frame would have defined order model performed. current framework provides single level propositions which define critical variables leadership emergence system align more closely with development model using system dynamics perspective.however formed propositions such that future works could current paper development formal models which then could adapted either form computational modeling. doing believe that offer unique complementary benefits studying both deep level surface level components overall leadership emergence framework.limitations this article developed framework that emphasizes importance multilevel process understand leadership emergence.although framework underlying structure designed include most fundamental processes leadership emergence view framework starting point future research continue unpacking dynamics leadership emergence. mapping process cannot empirically evaluate underlying process mechanisms leadership emergence hope that future works build framework statistically evaluating relative importance process mechanisms using techniques such computational modeling poile safayeni . addition focusing literature search psychology management areas have excluded theory research emergent leadership other domains such education.finally important note that process oriented framework incorporate full dynamic nature context.specifically well established that bottom processes emergence down processes context related dynamic reciprocal fashion kozlowski chao grand braun kuljanin .furthermore leadership emergence process understood embedded within greater social networks carter . example leadership both embedded with informal social networks .advice networks well formal hierarchical organizational structures .formal leaders . current paper intend address these exogenous contextual effects rather address carter colleagues call research that identifies endogenous rules principles governing leadership emergence carter . .finally although contextual effects directly incorporated into framework down constraints indirectly .illustration differing levels leadership entropy collective leadership identity activation process. .acton . leadership quarterly reflected incorporation contextual adjustments leadership prototypes foti lord .conclusions review shows diversity approaches area leadership emergence.although this diversity brought forth novel perspectives that enrich knowledge leadership emergence also presents several challenges that future research must address.notably framework have incorporated integrated process mechanisms from micro level perspectives self schema identity macro level complexity theory . have argued that attention these dynamic processes they unfold over time across different levels analysis critical because helps capture complexity that defines real individual group organizational systems.therefore efforts advance leadership theory research will require that attention processes that underlie these phenomena they occur multiple levels analysis.these levels exist both across social units within individuals move from surface structures emphasizing behaviors underlying identity structures. developing framework that focuses process leadership emergence involving both leadership identities help bridge disconnect between leadership emergence associated processes dinh thus paving major advancement within field leadership. close with quote from hunt dodge wrote know where going with leadership research must know where where have been must look backward forward same time . . been noted multiple times past idea informal leadership processes being distinct from their associated outcomes idea.nevertheless review indicated seems that field largely forgotten about progress made years study leadership processes.emergence theory describes processes that dynamic integrating relationship across moments time. other words past influences future future influences past. hope that review highlights this progress creates basis further advancement.acknowledgments

leadership emergence more than trait exchange symbol leadership emerges through dynamic interactions lichtenstein multiple levels. bales proposed that leadership emergence process begins with group member making proactive statements facilitate accomplishment group task. this member encouraged least given negative feedback then this member would continue make statements building upon initial suggestions.other group members begin expect further effective behavior from this member these expectations raise status that group member thus leadership position group bales .bales used categories

subsequently problems control concurrent with these transitions relative frequencies both negative reactions positive reactions tend increase.while bales does refer decision making process emergent

previously observed micro level coherence integrated wholes that maintain identity over time global macro level locus phenomena higher level dynamic attractors arise over time ostensive recognizable

deep level cognitive perceptual processes group members that form collective patterning leader follower interactions over time. area emergence sawyer contrasts emergence paradigms similar bedau notion strong .weak emergence. first paradigm collective emergence which holds that group behavior constituted individual action cannot reduced individual level.this holistic view emergence argues that

emergent phenomena. noted kozlowski goal understand process emergence through system dynamics across multiple levels simultaneously .similarly leadership highlights multilevel nature construct derue dinh wiley notion four levels subjectivity bridge micro macro level deduce process mechanisms inherent micro level dynamics that yield higher level phenomenon.wiley four levels subjectivity allow better understanding appreciation fundamentally interactive nature leadership emergence through emphasis importance interaction structure context. different levels discussed wiley intrasubjective individual intersubjective interactive generic subjective extrasubjective macroculture first level intrasubjective concerned with constantly emerging nature self. this level characteristics individual

levels involved leadership arguably most need advancement dyad which according gooty most neglected poorly understood level analysis leadership intersubjective level moves beyond single individual

subjective experiences individuals pure meaning which abstract idealized reality. believe study emergent leadership phenomena ripe further exploration using insights complexity perspectives emergence wiley idea leveled character reality.given that emergent phenomena multilevel process oriented both these perspectives introduce three emergence principles which served foci review leadership emergence literature. clear these principles largely derived from previous works within multilevel theory kozlowski klein which have been used primarily further study group team dynamics. relying these works first identify individual level elements which leadership emergence thought originate. individual level elements analogous wiley conceptualization self.then identify process mechanisms which individual elements integrated bridging wiley levels intersubjective generic subjective.finally kozlowski also discuss importance addressing potential variation emergent outcome over time include this aspect third principle. this particular attention deeper levels emerging structures such relational collective identities brewer because they often support more obvious surface structures such exchanges flynn leadership behavior venus lanaj chang .finally important note that while explicitly incorporated into these emergence principles leadership emergence process expected situated within greater context both informal relationships well formal organizational structures. kozlowski note although core characteristic emergence contextual factors higher level shape constrain process dynamics emergence review subsequent integrative framework focus identifying central principles that drive bottom process leadership emergence.accordingly while within aims this paper acknowledge that these emergence principles situated within greater organizational context.emergence principle elemental properties emergent process according multilevel theory every emergence process characterized lower level elements components.elements represent everything from neurons cognitions attitudes behaviors information events which meaningfully impact emergence process kozlowski morgeson hofmann hulin rousseau vallacher .these elemental properties critical understanding emergent process because they serve micro level building blocks higher level outcome klein kozlowski .elemental properties represent intrasubjective level wiley theory levels.leadership emergence theories that address this component emergence serve answer questions what elements relevant emergence process much each element impacts process what type effect emergence process.emergence principle mechanisms involved emergence process identifying elemental properties themselves only captures lower level ingredients emergence process does capture these various elements function together form higher level emergent outcome.according multilevel theory order have understanding process emergence necessary both define

outcome.kozlowski klein made point emphasizing that emergent outcomes fixed variable nature they often evolve change.thus third principle critical understanding emergent process because describes dynamics phenomenon after emerged.according kozlowski while emergent phenomena like leadership emergence often treated stable once they emerge they fact demonstrate within team variability over time growth trajectories other types trajectories cycles .this idea consistent with wiley notion that emergence does just happen once then stop well lichtenstein distinction between dynamic states emergent outcomes. also seen notion leadership functions being spread across group members morgeson across organizations dechurch time.therefore when theorizing about emergent process critical incorporate these temporal considerations which involve emergent outcome after emerged. order theory satisfy emergence principle three also must describe changes emergent outcome over time.this include form change that outcome demonstrates .discrete linear changes other temporal characteristics outcome quickly changes occur .kozlowski state that both emergent process resulting outcome cannot fully understood without discussing another.accordingly elements principle interactions principle dynamics emergent outcome principle three necessary gain complete understanding emergent property.overall applying these three principles derived from multilevel theory study leadership emergence argue that important insights gained regarding underlying processes driving leadership emergence.systematic

emergence .integrative framework leadership emergence results from literature review illustrate papers discussed underlying process mechanisms leadership emergence table using information gathered primarily from these works introduce process oriented framework leadership emergence which aims address three major objectives.first central component emergent process multilevel nature kozlowski incorporate three levels individual relational collective leadership emergence into theoretical framework.although previous theories have discussed informal leadership processes across multiple levels derue ashford review indicated that previous theories tended focus these levels rather than incorporate levels derue being notable exception this tendency reflects trends found leadership literature

incorporate most frequently occurring process mechanisms identified review starting individual level.from doing identify fundamental mechanisms leadership emergence self structures enacted structures. elaborate these specific categories following section. format framework follows. first introduce categories self structures enacted structures which used describe fundamental mechanisms emergence process.next describe emergence process occurs across levels over time.across these three levels describe process first terms role self structural properties followed role enacted structural properties system. incorporate most common process mechanisms theories each level found review.finally developing process oriented framework introduce propositions that could used guide future empirical estimation development testable formal models grand vancouver weinhardt schmidt examples begin this process providing specific propositions that represent emergence process each level.these propositions listed table .fundamental mechanisms describing basic nature organizations weick stated that they made interlocked behaviors that embedded conditionally related processes .this reflects findings literature review papers described emergence process principle using mechanisms either behaviors subsequent interactions occurring across individuals deeper level self information processes occurring within individuals which reflect their ongoing interactions table .specifically labeled these categories leadership emergence mechanisms self structures enacted structures.self structures refer cognitions related individuals produce process understand information about self .self identity self schema self concept nowak vallacher tesser borkowski .enacted structures refer behaviors expressions communications that performed support ongoing construction process between leaders followers weick believe self schemas self identities reflect deep structure leadership emergence because they fundamental input into self regulation wurf self regulation turn produces adaptive behaviors kanfer frese which view surface structure indication leadership emergence.according gatti chui sensemaking perspective helps move beyond static view leadership individuals richer understanding leadership socially constructed process that situationally embedded occurs across multiple levels over

literature review previous theories describing separate processes occurring different levels integrated into complete bottom representation leadership emergence process that relates table continued

other element categories with less were included will provided upon request. .acton leadership quarterly .acton leadership quarterly emergence both surface deep structures. theories describing organizational sensemaking continued develop idea organizational sensegiving added represent complementary process sensemaking. argue that both sensemaking sensegiving central processes necessary understand leadership emergence process.sensemaking represents process which individuals perceive ultimately organize complex information into coherent narrative weick sutcliffe obstfeld narrative they construct often reflects their personal identity work ibarra barbulescu contrast sensegiving represents process which constructed meaning conveyed others levenhagen this also reflected stories from which authentic leadership inferred others shamir eilam .sensegiving becomes particularly important within collective leadership context where each individual enacted unique understanding leadership followership. sensegiving concerns individuals influence others into adapting their definition organization reality gioia chittipeddi incorporate both sensegiving sensemaking into enacted structure portion theoretical framework describing process which individuals develop shared reality leadership.finally although both sensemaking sensegiving help individual construct their individual meaning within collective .self processes both viewed activities maitlis that individuals action construct both self understandings sensemaking well shape understandings others sensegiving .therefore while sensegiving sensemaking inform both self structures enacted structures they occur within processes related enacted structures.throughout explication process oriented theoretical framework leadership emergence table intended serve visual representation.this table illustrates specific self structural changes enacted structural changes that occur hypothetical four person group .this table also intended represent progression from individual relational collective levels.individual level self structures largest portion theories individual level discussed role self views self schema self identity emery daniloski hamby hall freiberg .according these perspectives individuals proceed both leaders followers within collective largely function they view themselves leader within given domain woolfolk .according this view individuals have expectations leadership prior interacting with others.work leader follower identity suggests that individuals specifically rely self schemas which cognitive structures that shape affective cognitive behavioral responses individuals each context wurf .self schemas domain specific .leadership domain they serve help individuals retrieve necessary information adapt changing goals within given context cross .therefore some individuals will have self schema leadership these self schemas will guide both their perceptions others their behavioral responses within leadership context. critical understanding about self schemas that they activated specific situational cues primes .therefore depending particular context people will shift between leader follower schemas .only will activated particular moment example person working with someone higher status they activate follower self schema while they activate leader self schema when interacting with someone lower status mainemelis .withinta .acton leadership quarterly context informal collectives leadership self schemas likely activated function both task environment other individuals within collective .social situation addition previous demonstrated that there will meaningful between person variability strength self schema within given domain depending prior experience individuals.according strength self schema indicated extent that individuals process information about self given domain with relative ease retrieve behavioral evidence from domain predict their future behavior domain resist counter schematic information about themselves.individuals that have well developed leadership selfschema would high these factors would viewed schematic leadership domain .this point critical shows that relative strength leadership selfschemas meaningfully impacts whether people will adopt leadership roles smith engle produce leadership behaviors .accordingly argue that individuals with more developed leadership self schema related given context will more likely enact leadership role early leadership emergence process.finally adopting recent process approaches leader identity further understanding generated about role self structures leadership emergence process differentiating them from self identities.specifically although previous works discuss leader follower identity critical self structures emergence process .emery more recent works suggest that leader identities develop until individual leadership self schema becomes contextualized into ongoing processes within collective chui this conscious situated identity constructed each person uses their previous experience self schema salient values enact identity that socially validated over time ashforth schinoff .derue recognized that leadership claims grants have consequences leadership identity development maintains that table findings emergence principle post

development involves deeper structure than leadership claims grants leadership discussed derue ashford .constructing situated identities area including leadership complex self regulatory process that engages many selfmotives involves affect cognitive processes involves crafting self narrative that will socially accepted.interestingly individuals have dedicated neural structures called default networks grounding self task historical contexts raichle representing role self structures early leadership emergence process important incorporate factors that will impact activation specific leader self schema within context.although concepts such gender central self concept most individuals therefore chronically available crane bernstein siladi leader self schemas presumed chronically available instead activated function additional factors .first previously described leader follower schema activation will function both task other individuals collective what label situation. clear these informal adhoc groups this point emergence process other informal relational structures have developed .friendship network carter .thus schema activation process situation reflects what described self

grolnick example within leadership context individuals that more committed collective organizational goals more likely activate appropriate leadership self schemas .this individuallevel cognitive structure differ among group members reflecting dynamic group level leadership structure mental model point will return later.based above rationale turn first step developing specific propositions which represent aspects micro processes associated with leadership emergence.although various propositions operate holistically reflect dynamics complex system they necessarily must developed individually.thus while multiple individuals emerge simultaneously within collective start focusing individuals. begin representing process leadership self schema activation person specific time point using following proposition.proposition activation leadership self schema particular point time will depend context that time prior experience similar contexts motivational states. noted derue individual level dynamic interplay between leader follower identities critical.thus addition schemas regarding leadership selfschemas regarding followership equally important. posit that activation

sensegiving behaviors.sensegiving behaviors provide direction foster integration that enables group effectiveness kozlowski watola botero .stein heller stated that development task leadership roles major thesis emergent leadership theories .consequently argue that performance these acts critical component sensegiving process within leadership emergence table .weick notion enacted sensemaking represents this stage emergence process. studying individual behaviors change over leadership emergence process found that early emergence process people focus solely task requirements whereas later they change their behaviors based original actions perceived others within collective strickland .this supports claim that early stage emergence process individuals performing actions based their prior experiences within that context confirmation denial others.thus initially amount type leadership acts performed individuals expected largely function their leadership self schema.specifically argue that probability leader behavior particular person time depends both leader follower selfschemas.proposition probability that individual will perform leadership behavior specific time will based whether activation their leader self schema greater than their follower selfschema that time.although expositional purposes propositions represent these processes developing past individual level relational group contexts part situation that activates leader follower schemas.subsequently reflected appraisal processes will play critical role relational level emergence process .further processes involved constructing situated identities emerge through series actions that play over time derue involve resolution ambiguity regarding oneself given situation ashforth schinoff .this could represented cumulating more precisely integrating propositions over given time period.relational level self structure relational level many theories literature review describe emergence process using leaders adjustment expectations followers additionally other works focused negotiation leader follower identities among members collective derue derue ashford marchiondo terms self these works describe leadership emergence process mutual identity construction occurring across individuals with differing expectations leadership.once emergence process reaches relational level expectation that individuals have begun incorporate feedback forming socially constructed leader identity thus argue that formation socially embedded leader identity serves evidence that emergence process begun emphasize relational level.this discrete transition gradual shift emphasis that merges intra individual with inter individual identity processes. critical change that occurs moving from individual relational level that individual leader self identity increasingly important component. example derue ashford model claiming granting whether individual claim leadership granted others within collective critical determining whether they will maintain leader identity.however there ambiguity regarding such processes. example whether individual actions with leadership prototype matter degree nothing process rosch lloyd different individuals hold different leadership prototypes creating ambiguity they interpret respond group activities. combining these works with works followership self schemas argue that deeper level this process confirmation driven part selfschemas followers.specifically actions leader activate follower self schema others then leader identity prospective leader socially confirmed shondrick .furthermore other works categorized relational level describe important role followers implicit leadership theory ocker benbunan fich hiltz schema activation

creating attractor double interact that depends active identities both parties.this represented propositions which although developed separately operate system that evolves over time. basic level implicit leader theories refer follower prototypes leaders within given context vader .according this work individual more likely perceive someone else leader prospective leader behaviors coincide with follower expectations leadership forsyth .taken together process leadership emergence argue that there match between characteristics behaviors prospective leader leadership prototype perceivers then they will apply category leader target depending goodness their .finally important note that this process occurring within each dyad signifying that this dyadic process occurring across multiple individuals simultaneously within overall collective.based this rationale represent extent leadership perception towards perspective leader perspective follower match between prospective leader characteristics prospective follower .proposition leadership perception specific individual specific time will based match between perceiver prospective leader perceived characteristics.enacted structure however leadership perception passive directional process.perceiving another leader implications perceiver well actor likely partially activate corresponding follower self schema. confirmation prospective leader self identity ultimately involves activation compatible roles that make sense each party identity this situation give sense other party. other words underlying double interact terms surface behaviors related claiming granting deeper double interact that reflects meaning mutually reinforcing identities.further this meaning discovered both parties enacted over time.this idea reflected sluss ashforth discussion relational identities encompassing both self identities role based identities .follower .thus relational level individuals begin simply because self schemas also based whether others perceive respond them leader that time. relational level many theories discussed enactment leadership emergence through variation what weick referred double interacts .according these works derue marchiondo interacts occur when .acton leadership quarterly behavior individual becomes contingent upon behavior another within system.leadership basic nature represents interpersonal influence kaiser hogan craig double interacts viewed basic describing interpersonal influence weick .according weick double interacts serve precursor collective understandings because individuals justify their interactions using collective explanation. example within leadership context person reflecting their interactions with person they could explanation that person leader within group that interacted with them that .thus these interacts help inform each person understanding leadership within collective.alternatively individuals think explicitly about such roles rather respond implicitly leader follower identities constructed over time through enactive processes.whether constructed implicitly explicitly affectively cognitively identities developed through double interacts reflect attractors that make sense past guide future interacts.thereby patterning leader follower interactions takes place derue .according shondrick construction leadership occurs when potential leader perceives infers group individuals followers when individuals group begin view themselves being that prospective leader. through these interacts that individuals begin rely both active self schemas situated provisional identities well perceptions reactions others.thus previously argued relational stage individuals begin transition from leader follower self schemas leader follower identities their self schemas become socially confirmed through double interacts.specifically dyadic level probability that single person will have leadership identity will function their activation leadership self schema addition leadership perception prospective follower.furthermore probability that person will activate follower identity will function their followership selfschema addition whether they perceive other person leader.finally self schema activation incorporates self perceptions within that given domain wurf represent probability activating leader follower identities propositions respectively. important note that proposition includes component pertaining leaders another pertaining followers thus reflecting mutual dependence double interact.proposition reflects self schema activation prospective follower well their perceptions their dyadic partner which internal representation double interact held this prospective follower.together propositions defined level that integrates self identity with both activation internal knowledge structures that self schemas leadership perception process.proposition probability that leader identity activated person depends that person activation their leadership self schema their dyadic partner leadership perception them that time.proposition probability that follower identity activated person depends that person activation their followership self schema their perception that their dyadic partner leader that time.these interacts represent micro elements process which leaders followers negotiate their individualized internal representations leadership .leadership self structures .these elements static indexing time implies they evolve over time leadership perceptions proposition important recognize that follower self schemas have many positive attributes such being productive going above beyond being team player that part leadership processes well.though initially have been guided follower schema individuals excel these factors perceived others exhibiting leadership communication these perceptions part process that activates leadership schemas. other words leadership times recognized others before being recognized oneself sveningsson paunova .this mutual form enactment further represented phenomenon synchronization which fundamental component dynamical systems blasius huppert stone .synchronization represents process which separate systems coupled within same environment demonstrate identical compatible dynamics over time rulkov sushchik tsimring abarbanel classic example synchronization fact that metronomes operating different tempos will synchronize same tempo when placed common base pantaleone .jiang found that leaderfollower relationships were characterized neural synchronization that occurred over time.specifically they measured communication frequency neural synchronization groups performing leaderless group problem solving task found that quality communication predicted neural synchronization emergent leader follower relationships.this critical during process sensemaking double interacts enable individuals develop shared understandings environment weick .thus argue that these leader follower interactions form synchrony behavior over time which begins manifest stable leader follower relationships that grounded situated identities well formation shared internal representations leadership within collective self structure this point emergence process leadership have fully emerged these double interacts developed into stable pattern interactions.weick argues that these interacts cannot viewed stable until both leaders actions become predictable followers subsequent actions become predictable weick other words perceptions both leader follower cross thresholds both individuals become mutually interdependent. believe that once these requirements leader follower identities begin solidify stable leader follower relationships formed.over time represent relational processes leadership emergence individuals performing actions function their self schema proposition well past acts have been confirmed which argue direct function leadership perceptions prospective followers.therefore through this confirmation process driven leadership perceptions self schema activation stable leader follower identities begin form rolebased attractors dynamic dyadic system these attractors guide subsequent dyadic interactions. interactions reflect only surface structure that supported deeper emergences synchronized identities specified propositions should stress that expositional convenience have depicted these micro elements structure relational level being independent collective level. relax that assumption discuss leadership identity structures collective level.collective level self structure common collective process mechanism found papers from literature review identification .most these papers specifically included identity theory leadership .this theory builds from relational level describing individuals begin view leadership terms specific group prototypes rather than their individualized leader prototypes reicher hopkins this point emergence process individual emerge group leader enough their behavior activate follower self schemas others addition emergence begins occur once prospective leader actions group leadership prototype .acton leadership quarterly .accordingly collective level once patterning interactions results followers contextualizing their follower schemas into stable follower identity this advances emergence process.furthermore followers develop follower identity context single prospective leader actions then that individual likely exemplifying leadership group prototype shared cognitive representation that collective leadership reicher collective level process identification represents critical identity work that underlies emergence process.according identification represents process which interests group become central each individual self identity.thus over emergence process through identification individuals expected shift from viewing leadership through their leadership self schemas viewing leadership through lens their group.this process gradual automatic connectionist systems that support categorization processes incorporate group context into contextualized implicit leadership theories harvey primary motivational driver this process uncertainty reduction .according this perspective viewing leadership differently than others within collective creates uncertainty about future. individuals seek predict control their world leotti iyengar ochsner this uncertainty leads internal tensions which provokes anxiety stress .thus reduce negative effects uncertainty individuals incorporate collective understanding leadership. each group member begins identify with collective level their potential leader follower identity becomes function both their leader follower dyadic self identities well collective leadership perceptions others within group.that probability that they will have leader identity collective level becomes function both their leader self identities well collective leadership perceptions that others group have them.additionally probability that individual will activate follower identity will function their follower self schema well whether they others perceive someone else perspective leader that time. represent this process propositions which include aggregation across group members dyadic level leadership perceptions reflect collective leadership identity person specific time point.proposition collective level probability that person leader identity activated depends both their individual leadership self schema activation well leadership perceptions others towards them.proposition collective level probability that person follower identity activated depends both their individual followership self schema activation well followership perceptions others towards them.propositions represent independent aggregation across dyads what been labeled compositional aggregation dinh kozlowski klein jennings however processes underlying dyadic identity formation interact form construct collective level which next paragraph maintain likely then collective leadership identities should qualitatively different than dyadic leader identities process that would termed compilational aggregation.compilational aggregation would also require adding component which reflects interdependence dyadic processes which addressed following section enacted structures. connecting individual level schemas formation collective identities identification represents meso process whereby individuals transition from external categorization internal identification.according identity theory tajfel turner categorization externally oriented concerns others identification internally oriented concerns self jenkins argue that this distinction critical understanding process leadership emergence because interpretation leadership changes orientations process crosses levels.specifically lower levels individuals view their interactions with others within collective external their self concept.however process identification occurs each person expected think about these collective interactions internally reference themselves. argue that shift from external categorization internal categorization begins capture when leadership emerged .collective structure formed .further when emergent leader identifies with group embodies group prototype self schema becomes more consistent with group level cognitive structure.enacted structure collective level other common process mechanisms were collective patterning interaction tension reduction .furthermore these mechanisms were primarily discussed papers that used complexity perspectives .lichtenstein bien .according these works emergence process represented patterning leader follower interactions over time.however complexity approaches beyond leader follower interactions discussing collective mechanisms that operate group level drive emergence process. major mechanism group level idea tension reduction that patterns leader follower interactions serve adaptively reduce tension ultimately reach collective goals hazy .this reflects idea collective identity individuals seek resolve internal tension uncertainty experienced when competing conceptions leadership occur addition internal tension uncertainty tension caused having adapt external environment viewed primary external tension within leadership emergence process schneider somers illustrate both these internal external tensions drive leadership emergence process pair complexity theory with other linear dynamical systems neural networks hopfield spin glass structures stein .according theory hopfield networks over time collective neurons explore different patterns activation reach minimum amount energy required produce outcome hopfield .regarding emergence process argue that this represents external tensions collective must perform specific pattern leader follower interactions meet environmental requirements.consequently argue that over time collective will enact specific patterns double interacts between leaders followers until most efficient pattern found. extend idea neural networks internal tensions that drive leadership emergence helps incorporate concept spin glass structures common phenomenon used complexity theory stein .spin glasses disordered magnetic materials which contain elements polarity .positive negative state .through local interaction each with adjacent units specific atoms within structure move from disorder coherent global pattern.thus structure resolves internal tension caused disequilibrium across atoms moving global state equilibrium. only this transition equilibrium fundamental spin glass structures this central tenet complexity leadership perspectives schneider somers .accordingly argue that just individual atoms within spin glass structure change positions align with other atoms structure terms have developed create double interacts through series interacts weick dyads shift their structure align with other dyads collective. example group four people leader follower relationship will more likely develop .acton leadership quarterly follower relationship .that double interact tends flip double interact this happens throughout group stable leadership structure emerges.furthermore this alignment collective reduces internal tensions driven uncertainty reflect this between dyad interaction would modify proposition which involves match leader characteristics follower form proposition which takes into account this group context introducing bias component that reflects this effect other dyadic relations group. assume that biases involving different pairs dyads encountered over time attention shifts from dyadic comparison another.proposition collective leadership perception towards individual group time depends match prospective leader characteristics each group member well additional biasing effect other dyadic leadership relations group.proposition thus translates dyadic process into group context reflects what klein dansereau hall have termed parts within wholes relationship. arguing then that group context changes dyadic leadership perceptions function through this biasing function that operates sequentially particular dyad compared other dyads .over time this comparison introduce variability into perceived eventually this variability will reduced more uniform structure evolves there shared perceptions person group members this point group level attractor exists biasing function becomes uniform across possible pairs dyads reflecting evolved common understanding group context. other words group well dyadic identities activated.importantly bias created group context also changes meaning propositions which based leadership perception process involving group well dyadic properties.therefore when leadership emerges collective phenomenon bias operates each dyadic level function solidified collective outcome.finally fully represent leadership emergence process occurs over time crucial incorporate idea entropy dynamical systems.according general systems theory entropy represents degree disorder within dynamic system skyttner .within realm psychology hirsh describe entropy great uncertainty about which state currently defines system argue that this accurately represents process leadership emergence where high entropy would occur system where individuals differentiate between they expected perform leadership role given moment leadership perceptions person towards each member group would relatively equal across individuals that group members perceived that individual.entropy will increase proportion number competing possibilities that must selected from. entropy levels represented tight distributions where outcome much more probable occur compared other outcomes whereas high entropy levels represented flat probability distributions where outcome close likelihood outcomes hirsh represent entropy terms collective leadership identities capture schematic understanding that reflects combined individual dyadic collective levels identity rather than behavior self schema represent deeper contextualized understanding self rather than moment moment variation surface level taskrelated behaviors. relative entropy function relative probability each individual will activate leader identity certain time. many individuals have high probability leadership identity activation collective will have high levels leadership entropy illustration .this represents level entropy within collective point time.thus critical component linear dynamical systems that they expected shift levels entropy over time prigogine .furthermore these changes entropy represent important structural changes emergent properties hirsh .regarding leadership emergence process collective entropy particular time this would mean that there clear collective understanding leader within that specific event.however over time members collective begin realize that this individual fulfilling group objectives external tension this cause members experiment with leadership roles. this occurred level both uncertainty entropy would increase within collective.however collective then finds structure leadership that resolve these external tensions they will adopt this attractor state with perhaps different persons identifying group leaders thus entropy levels will decrease once this attractor state reached.finally this theorizing about collective changes leadership over time aligns closely with review findings regarding principle .specifically reviewing previous works that theorize test postemergent dynamics leadership works focused collective level described important changes occurring over time collective leadership structure. illustrated table while early works studying nomination individuals found that leadership demonstrate stability over time task environment does change works teams networks found that collective continues demonstrate significant changes leadership structure klein ziegert knight xiao .furthermore these changes function multiple dynamic inputs form change expected linear with different elements affecting collective structure different points groups life cycle bien summarize argue that leadership emergence represented dynamic multi level process starting with deep structure elements self schema activation translating into contextualized identities function feedback. fundamental mechanism doubleinteract which each party both perceives other activates self identity that consistent with this perception when these processes align over group entropy stable group level attractor also exists.this collective leadership structure continues adapt dynamic environment.however emergent structure formed interaction each individual deep level cognitive processes which drive sensegiving sensemaking mechanisms leadership emergence. developing this conceptual framework describing leadership emergence process believe that have made primary contributions.first this framework captures emergence process develop individual dyadic group levels either sequentially simultaneously.second have specified variables based extensive careful review literature that capture both deep surface level structures.third have translated processes into propositions which guide future empirical estimation reflect dynamics leadership structure emergence both intrapersonal interpersonal basis.fourth overall framework indexed time reflect dynamic nature facilitate future works which incorporate temporal component that address changes over time.fifth have focused link between leadership identity because identity powerful schema that guides behavior skill acquisition motivation perceptions. other terms have taken deep structure approach understanding dynamic emergent processes.this provides important complement previous works that have approached emergence from multilevel perspective while focusing interactions among individuals which reflect deep level processes framework introduces .derue .finally have also grounded process theories leadership perception individual level uncertainty entropy group level .bridging levels .together these contributions advance understanding leadership emergence provide basis further develop process approaches. .acton leadership quarterly avenues future previous sections reviewed extant literature developed framework articulate basic elemental content what exchanged process mechanisms describing exchanged resulting emergence leadership. noted kozlowski this type emergent framework delves into deep details where leadership emergence model kozlowski chao .rather specification actual psychological behavioral action lowest level analysis that contribute emergence phenomenon framework focuses delineating underlying mechanisms leadership emergence process propose that future implement types computational modeling further develop ultimately test framework agent based modeling equation based modeling .however important establish that process oriented framework represents narrative theory that only used assist larger process formulating computational model intended directly translated into either type computation modeling.therefore explaining unique benefits both parunak savit riolo note where current paper leaves where future work would serve continue development modeling tools which study leadership emergence process. used test rules that lower level agents .persons follow when forming higher level bonabeau argue that used simulate enacted processes framework dynamic fashion.castillo trinh provide detailed explication benefits uses study leadership. order develop leadership emergence process specific assumptions would have stipulated regarding rules that agents follow within system. current paper represents what kozlowski grand would describe step larger process which they define narrative theory what individuals think feel that gives rise higher level outcome. grand .accordingly develop associated agent based model this process requires next step translating this narrative theory into series then statements which outline each agent would behave within overall system. example following model developed grand current framework would likely separated into categories statements related leader follower actions related leader follower perceptions.subsequently individual statements could introduced such agent leader self schema greater than their follower self schema then they perform leadership behavior.finally necessary include series group level statements which stipulate process which group reaches consensus .leadership emerged simulation ends.additionally been effectively used simulate complex intra individual motivational self related processes within organizational phenomena vancouver weinhardt vancouver weinhardt argue that uniquely used simulate deep level mechanisms driving surface level interactions which framework emphasizes.specifically vancouver weinhardt argue that using system dynamics perspective preferred testing phenomena intraagent level which level that framework specifically targets .cognitive processes .however previous works that implemented these types modeling procedures critical note current paper sufficient develop this type model.instead requires development formal mathematical expressions which used represent system interest.unlike protocol developing simulation protocol using system dynamics perspective would involve first defining variables system then specifying mathematical relations among these variables vancouver weinhardt should also noted that both appropriate temporal frame would have defined order model performed. current framework provides single level propositions which define critical variables leadership emergence system align more closely with development model using system dynamics perspective.however formed propositions such that future works could current paper development formal models which then could adapted either form computational modeling. doing believe that offer unique complementary benefits studying both deep level surface level components overall leadership emergence framework.limitations this article developed framework that emphasizes importance multilevel process understand leadership emergence.although framework underlying structure designed include most fundamental processes leadership emergence view framework starting point future continue unpacking dynamics leadership emergence. mapping process cannot empirically evaluate underlying process mechanisms leadership emergence hope that future works build framework statistically evaluating relative importance process mechanisms using techniques such computational modeling poile safayeni addition focusing literature search psychology management areas have excluded theory emergent leadership other domains such education.finally important note that process oriented framework incorporate full dynamic nature context.specifically well established that bottom processes emergence down processes context related dynamic reciprocal fashion kozlowski chao grand braun kuljanin .furthermore leadership emergence process understood embedded within greater networks carter example leadership both embedded with informal networks .advice networks well formal hierarchical organizational structures .formal leaders current paper intend address these exogenous contextual effects rather address carter colleagues call that identifies endogenous rules principles governing leadership emergence carter .finally although contextual effects directly incorporated into framework down constraints indirectly .illustration differing levels leadership entropy collective leadership identity activation process. .acton leadership quarterly reflected incorporation contextual adjustments leadership prototypes .conclusions review shows diversity approaches area leadership emergence.although this diversity brought forth novel perspectives that enrich knowledge leadership emergence also presents several challenges that future must address.notably framework have incorporated integrated process mechanisms from micro level perspectives self schema identity macro level complexity theory have argued that attention these dynamic processes they unfold over time across different levels analysis critical because helps capture complexity that defines real individual group organizational systems.therefore efforts advance leadership theory will require that attention processes that underlie these phenomena they occur multiple levels analysis.these levels exist both across units within individuals move from surface structures emphasizing behaviors underlying identity structures. developing framework that focuses process leadership emergence involving both leadership identities help bridge disconnect between leadership emergence associated processes dinh thus paving major advancement within field leadership. close with quote from hunt dodge wrote know where going with leadership must know where where have been must look backward forward same time been noted multiple times past idea informal leadership processes being distinct from their associated outcomes idea.nevertheless review indicated seems that field largely forgotten about progress made years study leadership processes.emergence theory describes processes that dynamic integrating relationship across moments time. other words past influences future future influences past. hope that review highlights this progress creates basis further advancement.acknowledgments would like thank anonymous reviewer their valuable comments suggestions that improved quality paper. also thank erika hernandez comments earlier version this article.'"
