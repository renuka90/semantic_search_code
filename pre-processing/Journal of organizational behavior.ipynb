2004 john wiley & sons, ltd.\\n\\nintroduction\\n\\nover the past two decades, a substantial amount of research has shown that the culture of an organiza-\\n\\ntion has implications for both the organization’s ability to implement its strategy and its ability to attract\\n\\nand retain employees. when an organization has a strong culture, that is, members hold a set of shared\\n\\nvalues, and when the culture is consistent with organization goals, it is generally assumed that the orga-\\n\\nnization will be better able to enact its strategy (sorensen, 2002). in addition, when individuals ‘fit’ the\\n\\nculture of the organization, that is, when an individual’s values are congruent with the values that define\\n\\nthe culture of the organization, individuals are more likely to be satisfied and less likely to leave the\\n\\norganization than if there is a lack of congruence (chatman, 1991; meglino, ravlin, & adkins, 1989;\\n\\no’reilly, chatman, & caldwell, 1991; vandenberghe, 1999; verquer, beehr, & wagner, 2003).\\n\\nat the same time that researchers have explored the overall effects of organization culture, the exis-\\n\\ntence of subcultures within an organization has been a widely observed phenomenon (hofstede, 1998;\\n\\njerimer, slocum, fry, & gaines, 1991). subcultures may develop within different functions, by pro-\\n\\nfession, practice areas, or by level within the organization (drucker, 1997; van maanen & barley,\\n\\n1984; wenger, 1998).\\n\\nin a recent review of the literature on subcultures, boisnier and chatman (2003) note that researchers\\n\\nhave typically thought of organizations as either having a strong overall culture or as consisting of a more\\n\\nfragmented collection of distinct subcultures. however, they argue that an organization can have both a\\n\\nreceived 6 march 2003\\nrevised 11 may 2004\\n\\ncopyright #

(kristof, 1996).\\n\\nbecause of the high correlation (r¼ 0.92) between the two measures of fit, assessing their indepen-\\ndent contributions of the two types of fit to satisfaction is difficult. for example, including both fit\\n\\nmeasures in a single regression equation introduces collinearity problems that make it impossible to\\n\\naccurately assess the independent contributions of the variables. therefore, we were forced to try indir-\\n\\nect ways to determine which type of fit was most important.\\n\\nfirst, we calculated the difference between p–o and p–g fit and included it in a regression equation\\n\\nalong with p–o fit and the control variables. although there are problems with using difference scores\\n\\nsuch as this, our logic was that the difference score would provide an indirect measure of the relative\\n\\nstrength of the two types of fit for each person as well as a measure of the level of fit. this analysis\\n\\nessentially replicated model 1 shown in table 2 but added the difference score in a third step. the first\\n\\ntwo steps of the analysis are identical to what is reported in table 2. adding the difference score in the\\n\\nthird step explained marginally more variance in affect (beta¼ 0.30, t¼ 1.76, p< 0.10). although the\\ntest and results are weak, this analysis suggests that exploring p–g fit may be useful in understanding\\n\\nindividuals’ affect.\\n\\nsecond, we attempted to identify whether there might be specific areas in which fit differed by look-\\n\\ning at the differences between fit scores within competency groups. since the means of both p–o and\\n\\np–g fit were approximately 0, we assumed that within any group 50 per cent of respondents should\\n\\nscore higher on each measure. we calculated one-sample chi-square tests to determine whether the\\n\\noverall distribution of scores differed from what should be expected. when the scores from all com-\\n\\npetency groups were examined together, the distribution of scores for individuals with higher p–o fit\\n\\n(or higher p–g fit) did not significantly differ from the expected distribution of 50 per cent (chi-\\n\\nsquare¼ 1.83). however, when the same analysis was conducted for each competency group a differ-\\nent pattern emerged. for both the change management and process management competency groups,\\n\\nthe percentage of individuals with higher p–o fit scores than p–g fit scores was greater than expected\\n\\n(change management� chi-square¼ 6.26, p< 0.01; process management� chi-square¼ 13.07,\\np< 0.01). the results were the opposite for the other two competency groups. a greater percentage\\nof individuals in the technology and strategy competency groups more closely fit the group culture\\n\\n(p–g fit) than the organization culture (p–o fit) (technology� chi-square¼ 13.33, p< 0.01; strate-\\ngy� chi-square¼ 6.00, p< 0.01). taken together, these results suggest that although there is no\\n\\ntable 2. hierarchical regression results for individual satisfactiony (n¼ 136)\\n\\nmodel 1 model 2\\n\\ncontrol variables\\nbusiness process group 0.14 0.13\\nstrategy group �0.01 �0.01\\nchange management group 0.09 0.09\\nsocialization 0.06 0.06\\nchange in r2 0.02 0.02\\nfit\\np–o fit 0.28**\\np–g fit 0.30***\\nchange in r2 0.08*** 0.09***\\noverall adjusted r2 0.09 0.09\\noverall f 2.54* 2.82*\\n\\nyentries are standardized regression coefficients. signs have been reversed so that positive\\nvalues are associated with higher levels of individual affect.\\n***p< 0.001; **p< 0.01; *p< 0.05.\\n\\nfirm or subgroup culture 975\\n\\ncopyright #
