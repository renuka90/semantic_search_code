through vertical exchange relationships, in-\\ncreasing interest in team or shared leadership that occurs apart from, or along with, the supervisor’s formal leader-\\nship calls for a better understanding of how horizontal peer exchange relationships may operate alongside vertical\\nrelationships. some research to this point has investigated vertical (lmx) and horizontal (tmx) exchanges in par-\\nallel (tse & dasborough, 2008). more specifically, though, it is not known if the limited time of employees is best\\nspent developing vertical relationships among supervisors and subordinates (lmx) or on the horizontal relation-\\nships among team members (tmx). day, gronn, and salas (2006) echoed this point by describing the diversity\\nin conceptual understandings of team leadership; they noted that there are many theories of team leadership (i.e.,\\ncollective, relational, and individual) and that mapping this territory is an important direction for this line of\\nresearch. such is thal of this study, to bring meta-analytic clarity and consolidation to what is known about\\nhow vertical and horizontal exchanges relate with one another and with important work outcomes, so that\\nresearchers are no longer limited to inferences from various sources.\\nmultiple theoretical and practical contributions em from the present research. for academics, this work pro-\\n\\nvides theoretical clarification of tmx and lmx social exchange-based constructs. in light of this theoretical\\nclarification, we are able to report an estimate of the magnitude of the correlation between lmx and tmx as well\\nas a quantitative summary of the correlations between tmx and four work outcomes (job performance, job\\nsatisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions) for the first time in the literature. from this, a clear\\noutline for future theoretical and empirical research is presented. additionally, this study moves beyond traditional\\nmeta-analytic reporting to explore whether tmx can provide incremental validity over lmx and whether lmx or\\ntmx demonstrates greater relative importance in each other’s presence when explaining work outcomes.\\nfor practitioners, this is also a crucial step whereby evidence-based, actionable advice is offered. for managers,\\n\\nwho have limited time and resources, knowing where to focus is a crucial point of debate. should managers focus on\\nthe quality of leader–member relationships? should managers focus on facilitating the relationships among team\\nmembers? the literature is conflicted. a summary of which organizational outcomes are influenced more by which\\nexchange (, leader or team) is provided. again, the theoretical and empirical landscapes within the literature are\\nclarified, and practitioners are provided with much-needed direction on how to influence critical organizational\\noutcomes. accordingly, several practical implications of these data are noted as well as recommendations for future\\nresearch aimed at improving the study of lmx and tmx.\\n\\ntheoretical background\\n\\nsocial exchange-based constructs\\n\\nlmx is founded on the notion that leaders develop relationships of different qualities with their subordinates (graen\\n& cashman, 1975; graen , 1977). the relationships that are of high quality are characterized by honesty, the\\nopen exchange of information, and support. leaders contribute opportunities, information, and support in exchange\\nfor effort, commitment, and proactive behaviors from subordinates (wilson, sin, & conlon, 2010). a growing body\\nof evidence has demonstrated the importance of lmx within the work group context (, ford & seers, 2006;\\nhenderson, liden, glibkowski, & chaudhry, 2009; tse, dasborough, & ashkanasy, 2008). yet, to this point, no\\nstudy has examined the magnitude of the importance of lmx relative to tmx in explaining variance in work out-\\ncomes (, job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions).\\nseers (1989) proposed the construct of tmx to represent the quality of reciprocal exchange among peers\\n\\nwithin

“the reciprocity between a member and his or her team\\nwith respect to the member’s contribution of ideas, feedback, and assistance to other members and, in turn, the\\nmember’s receipt of information, help, and recognition from other team members” (seers , 1995, p. 21).\\nthus, tmx represents exchange quality with other team members, not as unique individuals, but in their shared\\nrole as team members.\\nthe use of the word “team” in studies of tmx refers to an instrument of joint performance. we cite the definition\\n\\nproposed by kozlowski, gully, salas, and cannon-bowers (1996): (a) multiple individuals, (b) formed to perform\\ntask-relevant functions, (c) who mutually interact, (d) exhibit task interdependence, (e) possess one or more shared\\ngoals, and (f) are embedded in a broader organizational setting. all of the samples with tmx in this meta-analytic\\nreview reported data from individuals working within a context consistent with this definition of the term “team.”\\nthe work conducted by the teams varied from study to study (, research and development teams to telecommu-\\nnication teams); many of the samples involved project teams. in sum, tmx characterizes team members’ percep-\\ntions of the reciprocity and contributions between themselves and their team members.\\n\\nthe current study\\n\\nthis meta-analytic review focuses on the studies that conducted individual-level hypothesis testing, which reflects\\nthe bulk of the accumulated research. in summary of the relation between lmx and tmx, these parallel constructs\\naddress two different psychologically salient relational counterparts in work settings but are closely related by their\\ncommon derivation. both constructs draw upon role theory and social exchange theory, which emphasize reciprocal\\nreinforcements (jacobs, 1970), but with a few important differences. generally, one individual occupies the super-\\nvisor role while multiple individuals serve in team member roles. also, the nature of reciprocal reinforcement is\\ndifferent in the dyadic supervisor–subordinate relationship of lmx because supervisors have resources and power\\nthat their subordinates lack (graen, 1976). in the instance of tmx, team members are more likely to be on equal\\nfooting in terms of resources and power.\\nacross multiple individuals playing team roles, tmx recognizes that team members form a perception of their\\n\\nteam as a psychological object, to which they have an affiliative relationship (jacobs, 1970). tmx reflects how\\nindividuals see their relational interactions with other members as they represent team identity, rather than as unique\\nindividuals. this is in contrast to lmx where individuals form a specifically dyadic, reciprocal relationship with\\ntheir supervisor as a unique individual. tmx, then, ignores whatever differences there may be between specific\\ndyadic relationships among various team members.\\nlmx similarly reflects characteristic behaviors specific to supervisor–subordinate interaction. unlike tmx, super-\\n\\nvisor–subordinate relationships are specifically dyadic relationships, but the same interpersonal awareness, sensitivity,\\nand concern that allow some individuals to more readily forge strong relationships should operate analogously for\\nlmx as for tmx. as effective working relationships facilitate work performance, they also promote social attachment\\nand make on-the-job experiences more enjoyable. accordingly, we expect that both tmx and lmx explain unique\\nvariance in work outcomes. however, the nature of this contribution is also important to consider.\\nalthough lmx and tmx are distinct constructs (baugh & graen, 1997; seers, 1989), we suggest that individuals\\n\\nwho establish high-quality reciprocal exchange with their leaders (vs. those who fail to do so) also establish high-\\nquality (vs. low-quality) reciprocal exchange with their team. individuals who value high-quality relationships\\nand invest their efforts to that end will likely do so with respect to both their peers and their supervisor. even as\\nno two relationships in which a focal individual participates are identical, what that focal individual brings to differ-\\nent relationships must still incorporate the same characteristic attributes of the individual. for example, nahrgang,\\nmorgeson, and ilies (2009) and bernerth, armenakis, feild, giles, and walker (2007) found member personality\\ncharacteristics to correlate with lmx quality. thus, we hypothesize the following.\\n\\nhypothesis 1: there will be a positive correlation between lmx and tmx.\\n\\nteam and leader exchange 275\\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz.

is the case with all meta-analyses, this study was limited by the data included in the primary studies\\nidentified. unfortunately, several potential theoretically meaningful moderators have not received sufficient empir-\\nical attention necessary to be included in the meta-analytic review. in the discussion section, we review the aspects\\nof the lmx and tmx literature that require future research. despite the limited number of variables in the data, we\\nwere able to explore several potential moderators that might affect the magnitude of the lmx–tmx relation. these\\nmoderators were selected for exploratory purposes, and therefore, we do not make specific hypotheses regarding the\\ndirection or magnitude of the relationships.\\nwe include two potential moderator variables in each of two categories. one category addresses the potential for\\n\\ncontextual moderation. team-oriented practices and forms have become more widespread in general relative to\\ntraditional hierarchy, but we should not expect their spread to be uniform across industries and national cultures.\\nthus, we examined industry type, including professional (, software developers and bankers), industrial (,\\nassembly workers), and mixed or other samples. industry type might well reflect the organizational salience of\\nhorizontal versus vertical relationships because of mimetic practices. macro organizational research has shown that\\norganizations commonly pursueater legitimacy by copying practices and forms from each other and much of this\\ncopying follows industrial lines. industry type has been shown to moderate between constructs of interest in\\nprevious research (kim & mauborgne, 1993). golden (2006), whose study focused on the experiences of telecom-\\nmuters, found a more positive correlation between lmx and job satisfaction relative to tmx and job satisfaction. in\\ncontrast, kamdar and van dyne (2007), whose study examined the workplace experiences of employees in a large\\nmultinational conglomerate, found a stronger correlation between tmx and organizational tenure relative to lmx\\n(nonsignificant) and organizational tenure.\\nsecond, the nationality of participants in studies (, u.s. vs. international) might reflect the relative salience of\\n\\nvertical versus horizontal working relationships because of differing national cultural norms such as power distance\\nand individualism versus collectivism (ashforth & johnson, 2001). previous research has shown that differences in\\nsocial constructs, such as trust and reciprocation, likely exist between nationalities (buchan, croson, & dawes,\\n2002), and many examples of nationality-based moderation (, culture) have been used in prior social ex-\\nchange-based meta-analyses (, dulebohn, bommer, liden, brouer, & ferris, 2012).\\nthe second category included two potential moderators that might reflect method effects or method variance.\\n\\nhere, the lmx scale used was considered as a moderator. many examples of scale-based moderation have been\\nfound in previous meta-analyses (, o’boyle, humphrey, pollack, hawver, & story, 2010). in a similar\\nfashion, we explored the possibility that certain scales affect the relations here. in particular, we noticed that baugh\\nand graen (1997) found a larger magnitude relation between lmx and tmx than did liden, wayne, and sparrowe\\n(2000). from a theory-based perspective, we suggest that it could be the case that older, more established scales (i.e.,\\ngraen and colles) may exhibit a different relation relative to newer and less established measures (liden &\\nmaslyn, 1998). more specifically, whereas the measurement of tmx has been conducted by using\\nscales developed by seers and colles (seers, 1989; seers , 1995), the measurement of the lmx construct\\nhas been conducted with scales developed by graen and colles and liden and maslyn (1998). thus, we\\nconsider whether or not the relationship between lmx and tmx depends on the type of scale used. the final\\nmoderator investigates the possibility that published versus unpublished studies may differ in the quality of research\\nmethods or magnitude of the relations. thus, we investigated how the lmx–tmx relation might vary in published\\nversus unpublished sources.\\n\\nteam–member exchange and work outcomes\\nwe also explored the relations between tmx and job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment,\\nand turnover intentions, which are four of the most commonly researched outcomes in management and indus-\\ntrial/organizational psychology. to this point, the accumulation of empirical studies of tmx has not had the\\nsame benefit as lmx with respect to the progression of efforts directed at theoretical extension,

1987; graen & uhl-bien, 1995; sparrowe & liden, 1997).\\nthus, we do not focus on the relations between lmx and these four outcomes because previous meta-analytic\\nresearch has already demonstrated the magnitude of these relations (for theoretical logic and effect sizes, see\\ndulebohn , 2012; gerstner & day, 1997). therefore, the following set of hypotheses is focused solely\\non the relations between tmx and these four work outcomes (, job performance, job satisfaction, organiza-\\ntional commitment, and turnover intentions).\\ntmx, by reflecting high-quality working relationships within a team, should predict these outcomes.\\n\\nteams with high-quality, trusting exchange relationships are likely to exchange information and resources\\nand therefore better leverage the skills of individual team members through collaboration (hoegl & wagner,\\n2005). by better utilizing colles, team members are likely to achieve higher performance. relationships\\nthat allow those individuals to better anticipate each other’s actions and accomplish their work efficiently and\\neffectively will greatly facilitate teamwork. furthermore, high-quality exchange relationships allow team\\nmembers the opportunity to realize performance expectations of role senders (seers, 1989). as a result, team\\nmembers with higher levels of tmx are likely to receive better performance evaluations (kamdar & van\\ndyne, 2007; liden , 2000). accordingly, and not surprisingly, research has shown that higher levels\\nof tmx resulted in increased ratings of performance (jordan, feild, & armenakis, 2002).\\n\\nhypothesis 2a: tmx will be positively correlated with individual job performance.\\n\\nhigher levels of tmx are likely to have a positive effect on work attitudes, such as job satisfaction (major,\\nkozlowski, chao, & gardner, 1995). low levels of tmx may reflect troubled relationships with other team\\nmembers, and higher levels may reflect more congenial and more reliable coworker relationships. the benefit of\\nhigher-quality interpersonal relationships may be enjoyable to employees, and thus, they would experience more\\njob satisfaction. for instance, tse and dasborough (2008) argued that, through emotional contagion, positive emo-\\ntions in teams promote team member satisfaction. additionally, higher levels of tmx likely reflect more established\\nroles that are less prone to role ambiguity and should result in increased satisfaction (rizzo, house, & lirtzman,\\n1970). for these reasons, employees with higher-quality tmx are likely to experience higher levels of satisfaction\\n(golden, 2006; liden , 2000).\\n\\nhypothesis 2b: tmx will be positively correlated with individual job satisfaction.\\n\\nthe experience of strong relationships as reflected in high levels of tmx should support psychological attachment in\\nthe work setting, including increased levels of affective commitment, which is strongly tied to overall organizational com-\\nmitment (meyer, stanley, herscovitch, & topolnytsky, 2002). this is because teams with strong interpersonal relation-\\nships are likely to develop affective bonds between team members. by developing reciprocal exchange, on the basis of\\naffective relationships, we expect tmx to have a positive correlation with commitment. empirical evidence supports this\\nposition. for instance, major  (1995) found a significant relationship between tmx and commitment and attributed\\nthis finding to the important role that high-quality coworker relationships play in socialization. when discussing their\\nfindings of a direct link between tmx and organizational commitment, liden  (2000) contended that the association\\nis due to the support and guidance one receives from their interpersonal relationships with coworkers. in other words, co-\\nworkers are key agents for socialization in terms of the role development process of employees. the nature of one’s re-\\nlationship with these individuals is linked to one’s commitment to his or her organization.\\n\\nhypothesis 2c: tmx will be positively correlated with individual organizational commitment.\\n\\nindividuals’ turnover intentions are influenced by a variety of factors (lee & mowday, 1987). with respect to the\\npresent work, high-quality working relationships should affect individuals’ turnover intentions. research indicates, as\\nnoted earlier, that high-quality working relationships benefit individuals’ performance as well as their job satisfaction\\nand organizational commitment. these positive relations are due to the efficiencies and benefits of working well\\n\\nteam and leader exchange 277\\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz. behav. 35, 273–295 (2014)\\ndoi:

cost in its own right. and, not surprisingly, if one expects\\nhigh-quality working relationships and these expectations are not met, this situation is likely to increase one’s turnover\\nintentions (major , 1995; wanous, poland, premack, & davis, 1992). for these reasons, high tmx should be\\nnegatively correlated with turnover intentions.\\n\\nhypothesis 2d: tmx will be negatively correlated with individual turnover intentions.\\n\\nincremental validity and dominance analyses\\n\\nin order to demonstrate that a construct increases our ability to explain variance in work outcomes, the construct\\nneeds to explain additional variance above and beyond other constructs. furthermore, the construct must show its\\nimportance relative to other constructs. therefore, in order to illustrate value in both the social exchange literature\\nand the broader research field, both lmx and tmx must provide a unique contribution in predicting work outcomes\\nin the presence of related constructs. we evaluate the incremental validity of tmx above and beyond lmx.\\nthe lmx literature has enjoyed a greater amount of theoretical and empirical attention in theoretical (dulebohn\\n, 2012; gerstner & day, 1997; graen & uhl-bien, 1995; sparrowe & liden, 1997) and meta-analytic\\nreviews (dulebohn , 2012; gerstner & day, 1997; ilies, nahrgang, & morgeson, 2007). for instance, in their\\nmeta-analysis containing 51 studies, ilies  (2007) found lmx to have a moderately strong relationship (.37)\\nwith citizenship behaviors. further, in a more comprehensive meta-analysis containing 247 studies, dulebohn\\n (2012) found that lmx is a strong mediator of many important relationships involving constructs such as\\ncontingent reward, positive affect, and transformational leadership. from this body of work, we suggest that the\\nburden falls on tmx to demonstrate incremental validity.\\ntmx is a similar yet unique construct with respect to lmx, and consequently, we anticipate that tmx will explain\\n\\nunique variance above that already explained by lmx. we suggest that this will be supported because the dyadic rela-\\ntionships that characterize lmx are between supervisors and subordinates and therefore measure workplace relationships\\ndistinct from the peer interactions measured by tmx. again, these peer interactions form the perception of a team as a\\npsychological object with whom the team member holds a relationship (jacobs, 1970). therefore, tmx should measure\\nunique variance in the work outcomes that are explained by the quality of peer rather than supervisory relationships.\\n\\nhypothesis 3: tmx will demonstrate incremental validity above and beyond lmx in predicting work outcomes.\\n\\nalthough incremental validity tests are useful, they do not answer questions about the relative usefulness of vari-\\nables in a regression model (lebreton, hargis, griepentrog, oswald, & ployhart, 2007). accordingly, we use a\\ndominance analysis based on guidance provided in johnson (2000, 2001) and johnson and lebreton (2004). we\\nsuggest that lmx will explain the majority of the variance in each of the work outcomes relative to tmx. while\\nboth lmx and tmx measure the quality of exchange relationships, the supervisor–subordinate relationship of\\nlmx is unique in that supervisors have access to specific resources, information, and opportunities necessary for\\neffective job performance. supervisors also hold the unique power of being able to reward and punish subordinates.\\nthus, high-quality lmx relationships are likely to be more beneficial for individual job performance as well as ac-\\ntual performance evaluations. for these same reasons, lmx is likely to carry greater relative wt than tmx\\nwhen explaining job satisfaction and commitment. however, because employees likely receive social and emotional\\nsupport from high-quality tmx relationships, the wt of lmx in predicting these outcomes should be less dom-\\ninant. finally, lmx is likely to carry greater relative wt when explaining job performance, job satisfaction, and\\ncommitment; for the same reasons, it is also more likely to influence individual turnover intentions.\\n\\nhypothesis 4: lmx will demonstrateater relative wt compared with tmx when predicting work outcomes.\\n\\n278 g. c. banks \\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz. behav. 35, 273–295 (2014)\\ndoi: 10.1002/job\\n\\n\\n\\nthis meta-analytic review offers immediate contributions to the social exchange literature. first, we provided theoretical\\nclarification of tmx and lmx as social exchange-based constructs. what we learn from this study allows us to sharply\\ncontrast between tmx and lmx as relationships among peers within a team and the relationship between leader and\\nsubordinate, respectively. we demonstrate ways in which they are related as well as ways they are distinct constructs.\\nsecond, we presented the parameter estimate of the overall lmx–tmx relation as well as across various contex-\\n\\ntual moderators. we also provided estimates of tmx relations with work outcomes. our findings support the\\nperspective that there are positive relations of tmx with individual job performance, job satisfaction, and organiza-\\ntional commitment. as expected, tmx was negatively correlated with turnover intentions. this study thus brings\\nfurther clarity to what is known about teams by showing that one’s perception of the exchange quality across his\\nor her team as a whole is an important consideration, as opposed to one’s dyadic relationships with individual mem-\\nbers (i.e., member–member exchange).\\nthird, we reported the incremental and relative contributions of lmx and tmx. the results of the incremental\\n\\nvalidity analysis demonstrated the ability of tmx to contribute to the explanation of job satisfaction and organiza-\\ntional commitment above and beyond lmx. however, contrary to what was hypothesized, tmx did not provide a\\npractically significant incremental contribution over lmx in explaining individual job performance and turnover\\nintentions. consequently, there appears to be mixed evidence of the contribution from tmx in predicting work\\noutcomes relative to lmx. thus, while tmx does explain practically significant amounts of variance over and\\nabove lmx when predicting organizational commitment and job satisfaction (δr2 = 0.08 and 0.07, respectively),\\ntmx appeared to add little value when predicting job performance and turnover intentions (δr2 = 0.01 and 0.00,\\nrespectively).\\n\\nteam and leader exchange 287\\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz. behav. 35, 273–295 (2014)\\ndoi: 10.1002/job\\n\\n\\n\\nthe results of the dominance analysis mirror the findings from the incremental validity tests. while tmx\\nexplained approximately 40 percent of the variance in organizational commitment and job satisfaction, it explained\\nless than 25 percent of the variance in job performance and turnover intentions. thus, when investigating individual\\norganizational commitment and job satisfaction in a team context, tmx should be included as a variable of interest.\\nconsequently, the results present a complicated story in which tmx seems to play a critical role in some\\n\\ninstances, while in others it may not. the findings do highlight the importance of beneficial social exchange relation-\\nship with one’s leader, regardless of the relationships one has with one’s teammates. nonetheless, because of the\\nmixed findings, it seems unlikely that lmx will always be completely dominant over tmx. in fact, we suggest that\\nas research on tmx and lmx continues to em, we may see instances in which tmx is more dominant than\\nlmx, particularly when the outcomes that are investigated are more team oriented (, team cohesiveness and\\nteam performance). furthermore, we believe that better reporting practices (necessary to test for important moderat-\\ning variables), better comprehension of theoretically important moderators, and attention to a broader range of out-\\ncomes (including those that are team focused) will allow for a clearer understanding of what both tmx and lmx\\n“bring to the party.” for example, if we do not know how large teams are, how long employees have been a part of\\ntheir teams, how long employees have been developing relationships with their leaders, and how much autonomy\\nteams have from the leader, it is very difficult to make a conclusive statement regarding the contributions of\\ntmx and lmx in predicting work outcomes.\\ngiven the modest number of studies, particularly in some cells of our analysis, we must consider the type of error\\n\\nthat may be made if meta-analysis relies on too few studies. do we increase the risk of violating the assumption that\\nthe studies are normally distributed when there is a small k? when there is a small k, does it reduce the power of the\\ntest? herein, we use the most conservative methods possible (i.e., random-effects model) to ensure accuracy, yet\\nthere is still a need to issue appropriate warning to the reader. because tmx is still a developing research area,\\nall results of this study should be interpreted with caution. for instance, the veracity of results may be limited in\\nsome understudied cell(s). in time, when more research is brought to light on this subject, further conclusive results\\nmay be examined, which could bolster the present findings.\\n\\npractical applications\\n\\nfor practitioners, these results demonstrate the importance of developing both supervisor–subordinate relationships\\nand team member relationships. as organizational forms become flatter (bettis & hitt, 1995), greater research atten-\\ntion must be shifted towards horizontal, peer relationships, such as those found in teams. however, practitioners\\nshould not neglect the importance of supervisor–subordinate relationships and the need for high-quality social\\nexchanges here as well. as this study shows, team–member relationship quality and leader–follower relationship\\nquality relate to one another positively.\\nwe suggest four approaches firms may take to develop and maintain high-quality supervisor–subordinate and\\n\\ntmx relationships. first, firms need to monitor and evaluate exchange relationships. this can be accomplished in\\nmultiple ways. for example, 360-degree feedback assessments (morgeson, mumford, & campion, 2005) give indi-\\nviduals the opportunity to be evaluated by their supervisors, direct reports, coworkers, and themselves. such a prac-\\ntice can be used to identify strhs and developmental needs in employees’ knowl, skills, and abilities\\nnecessary to develop high-quality exchange relationships.\\nsecond, firms can structure training opportunities (potentially based on 360-degree assessments) for leaders\\n\\nand team members to develop the necessary competencies to ge in high-quality lmx and tmx relationships\\n(yukl & lepsinger, 1995). for instance, liao  (2010) pointed out that the leadership behavior individualized\\nconsideration, which is a skill that can be trained (barling, weber, & kelloway, 1996), has been linked with\\nhigher-quality lmx relationships. in addition to skills training, firms may elect to ge in training that is directly\\nfocused on developing interpersonal relationships, such as team-building exercises.\\n\\n288 g. c. banks \\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz. behav. 35, 273–295 (2014)\\ndoi: 10.1002/job\\n\\n\\n\\nthird, firms should consider implementing work structures and reporting relationships that facilitate the open\\nexchange of information, which are necessary to improve the quality of social exchanges. this focus on intentional\\nwork design, as a means to improve lmx and tmx relationships, would not necessarily replace needed training on\\ntechniques such as interpersonal skills. however, work design and employer attention to the social aspects of work,\\nand in particular, the increasing importance of teams, may foster more effective work environments (oldham &\\nhackman, 2010).\\nfourth, our findings that tmx relates positively with job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commit-\\n\\nment, and turnover yet only increments lmx for organizational commitment and job satisfaction are important\\nfor practitioners. time is a finite resource for those ged in business. thus, organizations wish to be as efficient\\nas possible with the time allotted to training and other interventions. for this reason, if a choice must be made in\\nallocating time between tmx-related and lmx-related interventions, those employees diagnosed with commitment\\nand satisfaction issues may be best served by training related to both constructs. for those diagnosed with job\\nperformance issues and the intention to turnover, under tight time constraints, interventions should focus primarily\\non lmx-related skills.\\n\\nlimitations and future directions\\n\\nas with most meta-analyses, a limitation of this work derives from shortcomings in the primary studies we reviewed.\\nfirst, too few studies of group-level factors in relation to tmx currently exist for examining how relational interac-\\ntions among peer coworkers shape the characteristic nature of teams, even as no team has a unique nature apart from\\nsuch interactions. moroup-level studies are needed, and especially studies that investigate how working relation-\\nships facilitate cooperation, coordination, and performance at the team level. longitudinal studies would be most\\nhelpful in this respect.\\nsecond, basic reporting issues limited the ability to explore moderators such as average team tenure and average\\n\\nnumber of participants per team. for instance, higher average team tenure may result in higher levels of tmx as it\\ncan take time for such relationships to develop. relatively speaking, lmx relationships with one individual (i.e., the\\nleader) may develop more quickly than tmx with multiple team members. the total number of participants per\\nteam may also play an important role. for example, larger teams may make it more difficult for a subordinate to\\ndevelop high-quality exchange relationships with the leader, as the leader likely has to attend to many more mem-\\nbers. lmx is founded on the notion that leaders develop exchange relationships of different quality. better reporting\\npractices in primary studies would allow for the testing of such moderating constructs.\\nanother potential moderator of the relative importance of lmx quality compared with tmx would be the extent\\n\\nto which a team has work autonomy from a supervisor (i.e., self-managed teams). teams with more autonomy\\nundoubtedly require less interaction with a leader and may ge in leadership behaviors within the team.\\nfurthermore, the need to develop high-quality lmx relationships will be attenuated, as leaders will be less likely\\nto control pertinent information and resources. therefore, future research should attempt to operationally define\\nand measure the extent of team autonomy in order to evaluate its moderating influence. additionally, future studies\\nshould indicate when team leaders are considered team members when measuring tmx. because of their status,\\nleaders are highly salient group members (connelly, gaddis, & helton-fauth, 2002), making them highly influential\\nteam members. it is possible that leader inclusion has an effect on tmx ratings by team members. for this reason,\\nfuture research should investigate team leader inclusion as a moderator.\\nthird, differentiation has also been considered as an important factor when exploring lmx within work groups\\n\\n(ford & seers, 2006; liao , 2010), but not enough primary studies currently exist to incorporate it into a meta-\\nanalysis. differentiation is characterized by the extent of quality variability in lmx and tmx relationships. previ-\\nous research has demonstrated that lmx differentiation attenuated the value of lmx quality while it augmented the\\nvalue of tmx quality on self-efficacy and creativity (liao , 2010). thus, more studies should investigate dif-\\nferentiation as an important construct to be considered. additionally, we know of only one study, an unpublished\\n\\nteam and leader exchange 289\\n\\ncopyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd. j. organiz. behav. 35, 273–295 (2014)\\ndoi: 10.1002/job\\n\\n\\n\\ndoctoral dissertation (keup, 2000), that has attempted to directly compare dyadic peer aggregation with tmx, but\\npublishable research comparing tmx with dyadic peer analysis remains an important gap in the literature.\\nfinally, further studies are needed for better understanding other outcomes, such as citizenship behaviors and coun-\\n\\nterproductive work behavior, as well as team-focused outcomes, including team cohesiveness and team performance. it\\nis likely that the relative importance of tmx, compared with lmx, is greater in work situations in which success is\\ncontingent upon strong social exchange relationships between team members. furthermore, perceived organizational\\nsupport (pos) should also be considered in future research. unfortunately, the number of samples with pos was too\\nsmall to include in this meta-analytic review. individuals have a somewhat affiliative relationship to the employing\\norganization as a psychological object. eisenbr, huntington, hutchison, and sowa (1986) based their proposal of\\nthe pos construct on levinson’s (1965) observation that individuals personify their employing organization, viewing\\nactions by organizational agents as actions of the organization itself. this personification is integral to an employee’s\\nsense of a psychological contract (rousseau & parks, 1992) as a reciprocal exchange relationship with the organization.\\nposmay complement lmx and tmx, or it may provide redundant information. thus, future research should consider\\nthe relative wt of pos as well as the potential incremental validity above and beyond lmx and tmx.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nthe use of teams within firms has continued to increase over recent decades in order to better capitalize on the\\nsynst effects of collaboration. the results of this study provide mixed evidence for the contribution of tmx,\\ncompared with lmx, when predicting outcomes in the workplace. tmx did demonstrate incremental validity\\nand a moderate relative contribution when predicting organizational commitment and job satisfaction, but tmx\\nadded little value when predicting job performance and turnover intentions.\\nresearch on tmx continues to increase (anand , 2010; dierdorff , 2011; liao , 2010; liao, yang,\\n\\nwang, drown, & shi, ; muñoz-doyague & nieto, 2012). yet, a re-focused research agenda that includes better\\nreporting practices, the inclusion of theoretically meaningful moderators, and a broader range of outcomes (,\\nteam-oriented outcomes) is needed. thus, while it appears that tmx adds value in predicting some outcomes, more\\nresearch is needed in order to identify, under differing conditions, the relative and unique contributions of tmx and\\nlmx quality within work groups.\\n\\nacknowlment\\n\\nsuggestions by michael a. mcdaniel were valuable in the improvement of this paper and wereatly

summary both leader member exchange and team member exchange measure the quality of reciprocal exchange among employees in the workplace. although lmx focuses on supervisor subordinate relationships while tmx examines the relationships among team members both have theory-based and empirically proven relations with workplace outcomes such as job performance organizational commitment job satisfaction and turnover intentions. however it is not yet known which has more of an impact on such workplace outcomes specifically it is not clear if an employee time is best spent developing vertical relationships among supervisors and subordinates or on the horizontal relationships among team members. accordingly this meta-analysis explores the incremental validity and relative importance of these two social exchange-based constructs. the theoretical logic underlying lmx and tmx is clarified and the parameter estimates between lmx tmx and work outcomes are reported. results demonstrate that tmx shows incremental validity above and beyond lmx for some outcomes but not others. also lmx shows greater relative importance across all four outcomes. in sum the clarification of the theoretical and empirical landscape lays foundation for recommendations for future research. copyright john wiley sons ltd. keywords leader member exchange team member exchange social exchange theory organizational commitment job satisfaction job performance turnover intentions research on role processes in organizational environments dates back over half century. however much of the contemporary research focuses on supervisor subordinate role relationships negotiated through social exchange processes as described by leader member exchange theory. although the nature of this vertical relationship is important to consider as organizational forms become flatter its salience may diminish relative to horizontal relationships seen in work teams. over recent decades organizational structures have been increasingly designed around teams because of their ability to leverage individual knowl and skills. subsequently recent empirical work has dedicated greater attention to studies that explore the quality of social exchange relationships within work groups as described by team member exchange theory. yet to date there is no substantive empirical evidence to determine whether one form of social exchange still matters in the presence of the other. accordingly the quandary in the literature is that we do correspondence to george. banks longwood university high street farmville virginia s.  copyright john wiley sons ltd. received january revised june accepted june journal of organizational behavior. organiz. behav.  published online july in wiley online library doi. job. esearch rticle not know the incremental and relative contributions of lmx and tmx with regards to key workplace outcomes including job performance job satisfaction organizational commitment and turnover intentions. as team-oriented structures arowing in prevalence more complete understanding of social exchange rela tionships within work groups can aid both practitioners and researchers. just as work on lmx has made clear that the actual process of supervisory leadership occurs through vertical exchange relationships increasing interest in team or shared leadership that occurs apart from or along with the supervisor formal leadership calls for better understanding of how horizontal peer exchange relationships may operate alongside vertical relationships. some research to this point has investigated vertical and horizontal exchanges in parallel. more specifically though it is not known if the limited time of employees is best spent developing vertical relationships among supervisors and subordinates or on the horizontal relationships among team members. day gronn and salas echoed this point by describing the diversity in conceptual understandings of team leadership they noted that there are many theories of team leadership and that mapping this territory is an important direction for this line of research. such is thal of this study to bring meta-analytic clarity and consolidation to what is known about how vertical and horizontal exchanges relate with one another and with important work outcomes so that researchers are no longer limited to inferences from various sources. multiple theoretical and practical contributions em from the present research. for academics this work pro vides theoretical clarification of tmx and lmx social exchange-based constructs. in light of this theoretical clarification we are able to report an estimate of the magnitude of the correlation between lmx and tmx as well as quantitative summary of the correlations between tmx and four work outcomes for the first time in the literature. from this clear outline for future theoretical and empirical research is presented. additionally this study moves beyond traditional meta-analytic reporting to explore whether tmx can provide incremental validity over lmx and whether lmx or tmx demonstrates greater relative importance in each other presence when explaining work outcomes. for practitioners this is also crucial step whereby evidence-based actionable advice is offered. for managers who have limited time and resources knowing where to focus is crucial point of debate. should managers focus on the quality of leader member relationships. should managers focus on facilitating the relationships among team members. the literature is conflicted. summary of which organizational outcomes are influenced more by which exchange is provided. again the theoretical and empirical landscapes within the literature are clarified and practitioners are provided with much-needed direction on how to influence critical organizational outcomes. accordingly several practical implications of these data are noted as well as recommendations for future research aimed at improving the study of lmx and tmx. theoretical background social exchange-based constructs lmx is founded on the notion that leaders develop relationships of different qualities with their subordinates. the relationships that are of high quality are characterized by honesty the open exchange of information and support. leaders contribute opportunities information and support in exchange for effort commitment and proactive behaviors from subordinates. growing body of evidence has demonstrated the importance of lmx within the work group context. yet to this point no study has examined the magnitude of the importance of lmx relative to tmx in explaining variance in work outcomes. seers proposed the construct of tmx to represent the quality of reciprocal exchange among peers within team. tmx was adapted from lmx and represents an individual perception of the exchange quality.. banks copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job of his or her role relationship interactions with other team members. tmx has been formally defined as team member perception of the quality of the reciprocity between member and his or her team with respect to the member contribution of ideas feedback and assistance to other members and in turn the member receipt of information help and recognition from other team members. thus tmx represents exchange quality with other team members not as unique individuals but in their shared role as team members. the use of the word team in studies of tmx refers to an instrument of joint performance. we cite the definition proposed by kozlowski gully salas and cannon-bowers multiple individuals formed to perform task-relevant functions who mutually interact exhibit task interdependence possess one or more shared goals and are embedded in broader organizational setting. all of the samples with tmx in this meta-analytic review reported data from individuals working within context consistent with this definition of the term team.  the work conducted by the teams varied from study to study many of the samples involved project teams. in sum tmx characterizes team members perceptions of the reciprocity and contributions between themselves and their team members. the current study this meta-analytic review focuses on the studies that conducted individual-level hypothesis testing which reflects the bulk of the accumulated research. in summary of the relation between lmx and tmx these parallel constructs address two different psychologically salient relational counterparts in work settings but are closely related by their common derivation. both constructs draw upon role theory and social exchange theory which emphasize reciprocal reinforcements but with few important differences. generally one individual occupies the supervisor role while multiple individuals serve in team member roles. also the nature of reciprocal reinforcement is different in the dyadic supervisor subordinate relationship of lmx because supervisors have resources and power that their subordinates lack. in the instance of tmx team members are more likely to be on equal footing in terms of resources and power. across multiple individuals playing team roles tmx recognizes that team members form perception of their team as psychological object to which they have an affiliative relationship. tmx reflects how individuals see their relational interactions with other members as they represent team identity rather than as unique individuals. this is in contrast to lmx where individuals form specifically dyadic reciprocal relationship with their supervisor as unique individual. tmx then ignores whatever differences there may be between specific dyadic relationships among various team members. lmx similarly reflects characteristic behaviors specific to supervisor subordinate interaction. unlike tmx super visor subordinate relationships are specifically dyadic relationships but the same interpersonal awareness sensitivity and concern that allow some individuals to more readily forge strong relationships should operate analogously for lmx as for tmx. as effective working relationships facilitate work performance they also promote social attachment and make on-the-job experiences more enjoyable. accordingly we expect that both tmx and lmx explain unique variance in work outcomes. however the nature of this contribution is also important to consider. although lmx and tmx are distinct constructs we suggest that individuals who establish high-quality reciprocal exchange with their leaders also establish highquality reciprocal exchange with their team. individuals who value high-quality relationships and invest their efforts to that end will likely do so with respect to both their peers and their supervisor. even as no two relationships in which focal individual participates are identical what that focal individual brings to different relationships must still incorporate the same characteristic attributes of the individual. for example nahrgang morgeson and ilies and bernerth armenakis feild giles and walker found member personality characteristics to correlate with lmx quality. thus we hypothesize the following. hypothesis there will be positive correlation between lmx and tmx. team and leader exchange copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job moderators we consider several potential moderators of the lmx tmx relation industry scale used nationality and publication status. as is the case with all meta-analyses this study was limited by the data included in the primary studies identified. unfortunately several potential theoretically meaningful moderators have not received sufficient empirical attention necessary to be included in the meta-analytic review. in the discussion section we review the aspects of the lmx and tmx literature that require future research. despite the limited number of variables in the data we were able to explore several potential moderators that might affect the magnitude of the lmx tmx relation. these moderators were selected for exploratory purposes and therefore we do not make specific hypotheses regarding the direction or magnitude of the relationships. we include two potential moderator variables in each of two categories. one category addresses the potential for contextual moderation. team-oriented practices and forms have become more widespread in general relative to traditional hierarchy but we should not expect their spread to be uniform across industries and national cultures. thus we examined industry type including professional industrial and mixed or other samples. industry type might well reflect the organizational salience of horizontal versus vertical relationships because of mimetic practices. macro organizational research has shown that organizations commonly pursueater legitimacy by copying practices and forms from each other and much of this copying follows industrial lines. industry type has been shown to moderate between constructs of interest in previous research. golden whose study focused on the experiences of telecommuters found more positive correlation between lmx and job satisfaction relative to tmx and job satisfaction. in contrast kamdar and van dyne whose study examined the workplace experiences of employees in large multinational conglomerate found stronger correlation between tmx and organizational tenure relative to lmx and organizational tenure. second the nationality of participants in studies might reflect the relative salience of vertical versus horizontal working relationships because of differing national cultural norms such as power distance and individualism versus collectivism. previous research has shown that differences in social constructs such as trust and reciprocation likely exist between nationalities and many examples of nationality-based moderation have been used in prior social exchange-based meta-analyses. the second category included two potential moderators that might reflect method effects or method variance. here the lmx scale used was considered as moderator. many examples of scale-based moderation have been found in previous meta-analyses. in similar fashion we explored the possibility that certain scales affect the relations here. in particular we noticed that baugh and graen found larger magnitude relation between lmx and tmx than did liden wayne and sparrowe. from theory-based perspective we suggest that it could be the case that older more established scales may exhibit different relation relative to newer and less established measures. more specifically whereas the measurement of tmx has been conducted by using scales developed by seers and colles the measurement of the lmx construct has been conducted with scales developed by graen and colles and liden and maslyn. thus we consider whether or not the relationship between lmx and tmx depends on the type of scale used. the final moderator investigates the possibility that published versus unpublished studies may differ in the quality of research methods or magnitude of the relations. thus we investigated how the lmx tmx relation might vary in published versus unpublished sources. team member exchange and work outcomes we also explored the relations between tmx and job performance job satisfaction organizational commitment and turnover intentions which are four of the most commonly researched outcomes in management and industrial organizational psychology. to this point the accumulation of empirical studies of tmx has not had the same benefit as lmx with respect to the progression of efforts directed at theoretical extension conceptual.. banks copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job refinement and clarification. thus we do not focus on the relations between lmx and these four outcomes because previous meta-analytic research has already demonstrated the magnitude of these relations. therefore the following set of hypotheses is focused solely on the relations between tmx and these four work outcomes. tmx by reflecting high-quality working relationships within team should predict these outcomes. teams with high-quality trusting exchange relationships are likely to exchange information and resources and therefore better leverage the skills of individual team members through collaboration. by better utilizing colles team members are likely to achieve higher performance. relationships that allow those individuals to better anticipate each other actions and accomplish their work efficiently and effectively will greatly facilitate teamwork. furthermore high-quality exchange relationships allow team members the opportunity to realize performance expectations of role senders. as result team members with higher levels of tmx are likely to receive better performance evaluations. accordingly and not surprisingly research has shown that higher levels of tmx resulted in increased ratings of performance. hypothesis tmx will be positively correlated with individual job performance. higher levels of tmx are likely to have positive effect on work attitudes such as job satisfaction. low levels of tmx may reflect troubled relationships with other team members and higher levels may reflect more congenial and more reliable coworker relationships. the benefit of higher-quality interpersonal relationships may be enjoyable to employees and thus they would experience more job satisfaction. for instance tse and dasborough argued that through emotional contagion positive emotions in teams promote team member satisfaction. additionally higher levels of tmx likely reflect more established roles that are less prone to role ambiguity and should result in increased satisfaction. for these reasons employees with higher-quality tmx are likely to experience higher levels of satisfaction. hypothesis tmx will be positively correlated with individual job satisfaction. the experience of strong relationships as reflected in high levels of tmx should support psychological attachment in the work setting including increased levels of affective commitment which is strongly tied to overall organizational commitment. this is because teams with strong interpersonal relationships are likely to develop affective bonds between team members. by developing reciprocal exchange on the basis of affective relationships we expect tmx to have positive correlation with commitment. empirical evidence supports this position. for instance major found significant relationship between tmx and commitment and attributed this finding to the important role that high-quality coworker relationships play in socialization. when discussing their findings of direct link between tmx and organizational commitment liden contended that the association is due to the support and guidance one receives from their interpersonal relationships with coworkers. in other words coworkers are key agents for socialization in terms of the role development process of employees. the nature of one relationship with these individuals is linked to one commitment to his or her organization. hypothesis tmx will be positively correlated with individual organizational commitment. individuals turnover intentions are influenced by variety of factors. with respect to the present work high-quality working relationships should affect individuals turnover intentions. research indicates as noted earlier that high-quality working relationships benefit individuals performance as well as their job satisfaction and organizational commitment. these positive relations are due to the efficiencies and benefits of working well team and leader exchange copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job together and when individuals work well together that decreases any desire to exit the organization. put differently giving up good relationships at work is an opportunity cost in its own right. and not surprisingly if one expects high-quality working relationships and these expectations are not met this situation is likely to increase one turnover intentions. for these reasons high tmx should be negatively correlated with turnover intentions. hypothesis tmx will be negatively correlated with individual turnover intentions. incremental validity and dominance analyses in order to demonstrate that construct increases our ability to explain variance in work outcomes the construct needs to explain additional variance above and beyond other constructs. furthermore the construct must show its importance relative to other constructs. therefore in order to illustrate value in both the social exchange literature and the broader research field both lmx and tmx must provide unique contribution in predicting work outcomes in the presence of related constructs. we evaluate the incremental validity of tmx above and beyond lmx. the lmx literature has enjoyed greater amount of theoretical and empirical attention in theoretical and meta-analytic reviews. for instance in their meta-analysis containing studies ilies found lmx to have moderately strong relationship with citizenship behaviors. further in more comprehensive meta-analysis containing studies dulebohn found that lmx is strong mediator of many important relationships involving constructs such as contingent reward positive affect and transformational leadership. from this body of work we suggest that the burden falls on tmx to demonstrate incremental validity. tmx is similar yet unique construct with respect to lmx and consequently we anticipate that tmx will explain unique variance above that already explained by lmx. we suggest that this will be supported because the dyadic relationships that characterize lmx are between supervisors and subordinates and therefore measure workplace relationships distinct from the peer interactions measured by tmx. again these peer interactions form the perception of team as psychological object with whom the team member holds relationship. therefore tmx should measure unique variance in the work outcomes that are explained by the quality of peer rather than supervisory relationships. hypothesis tmx will demonstrate incremental validity above and beyond lmx in predicting work outcomes. although incremental validity tests are useful they do not answer questions about the relative usefulness of variables in regression model. accordingly we use dominance analysis based on guidance provided in johnson and johnson and lebreton. we suggest that lmx will explain the majority of the variance in each of the work outcomes relative to tmx. while both lmx and tmx measure the quality of exchange relationships the supervisor subordinate relationship of lmx is unique in that supervisors have access to specific resources information and opportunities necessary for effective job performance. supervisors also hold the unique power of being able to reward and punish subordinates. thus high-quality lmx relationships are likely to be more beneficial for individual job performance as well as actual performance evaluations. for these same reasons lmx is likely to carry greater relative wt than tmx when explaining job satisfaction and commitment. however because employees likely receive social and emotional support from high-quality tmx relationships the wt of lmx in predicting these outcomes should be less dominant. finally lmx is likely to carry greater relative wt when explaining job performance job satisfaction and commitment for the same reasons it is also more likely to influence individual turnover intentions. hypothesis lmx will demonstrateater relative wt compared with tmx when predicting work outcomes... banks copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job this meta-analytic review offers immediate contributions to the social exchange literature. first we provided theoretical clarification of tmx and lmx as social exchange-based constructs. what we learn from this study allows us to sharply contrast between tmx and lmx as relationships among peers within team and the relationship between leader and subordinate respectively. we demonstrate ways in which they are related as well as ways they are distinct constructs. second we presented the parameter estimate of the overall lmx tmx relation as well as across various contex tual moderators. we also provided estimates of tmx relations with work outcomes. our findings support the perspective that there are positive relations of tmx with individual job performance job satisfaction and organizational commitment. as expected tmx was negatively correlated with turnover intentions. this study thus brings further clarity to what is known about teams by showing that one perception of the exchange quality across his or her team as whole is an important consideration as opposed to one dyadic relationships with individual members. third we reported the incremental and relative contributions of lmx and tmx. the results of the incremental validity analysis demonstrated the ability of tmx to contribute to the explanation of job satisfaction and organizational commitment above and beyond lmx. however contrary to what was hypothesized tmx did not provide practically significant incremental contribution over lmx in explaining individual job performance and turnover intentions. consequently there appears to be mixed evidence of the contribution from tmx in predicting work outcomes relative to lmx. thus while tmx does explain practically significant amounts of variance over and above lmx when predicting organizational commitment and job satisfaction tmx appeared to add little value when predicting job performance and turnover intentions. team and leader exchange copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job the results of the dominance analysis mirror the findings from the incremental validity tests. while tmx explained approximately percent of the variance in organizational commitment and job satisfaction it explained less than percent of the variance in job performance and turnover intentions. thus when investigating individual organizational commitment and job satisfaction in team context tmx should be included as variable of interest. consequently the results present complicated story in which tmx seems to play critical role in some instances while in others it may not. the findings do highlight the importance of beneficial social exchange relationship with one leader regardless of the relationships one has with one teammates. nonetheless because of the mixed findings it seems unlikely that lmx will always be completely dominant over tmx. in fact we suggest that as research on tmx and lmx continues to em we may see instances in which tmx is more dominant than lmx particularly when the outcomes that are investigated are more team oriented. furthermore we believe that better reporting practices better comprehension of theoretically important moderators and attention to broader range of outcomes will allow for clearer understanding of what both tmx and lmx bring to the party.  for example if we do not know how large teams are how long employees have been part of their teams how long employees have been developing relationships with their leaders and how much autonomy teams have from the leader it is very difficult to make conclusive statement regarding the contributions of tmx and lmx in predicting work outcomes. given the modest number of studies particularly in some cells of our analysis we must consider the type of error that may be made if meta-analysis relies on too few studies. do we increase the risk of violating the assumption that the studies are normally distributed when there is small. when there is small does it reduce the power of the test. herein we use the most conservative methods possible to ensure accuracy yet there is still need to issue appropriate warning to the reader. because tmx is still developing research area all results of this study should be interpreted with caution. for instance the veracity of results may be limited in some understudied cell. in time when more research is brought to light on this subject further conclusive results may be examined which could bolster the present findings. practical applications for practitioners these results demonstrate the importance of developing both supervisor subordinate relationships and team member relationships. as organizational forms become flatter greater research attention must be shifted towards horizontal peer relationships such as those found in teams. however practitioners should not neglect the importance of supervisor subordinate relationships and the need for high-quality social exchanges here as well. as this study shows team member relationship quality and leader follower relationship quality relate to one another positively. we suggest four approaches firms may take to develop and maintain high-quality supervisor subordinate and tmx relationships. first firms need to monitor and evaluate exchange relationships. this can be accomplished in multiple ways. for example -degree feedback assessments give individuals the opportunity to be evaluated by their supervisors direct reports coworkers and themselves. such practice can be used to identify strhs and developmental needs in employees knowl skills and abilities necessary to develop high-quality exchange relationships. second firms can structure training opportunities for leaders and team members to develop the necessary competencies to ge in high-quality lmx and tmx relationships. for instance liao pointed out that the leadership behavior individualized consideration which is skill that can be trained has been linked with higher-quality lmx relationships. in addition to skills training firms may elect to ge in training that is directly focused on developing interpersonal relationships such as team-building exercises... banks copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job third firms should consider implementing work structures and reporting relationships that facilitate the open exchange of information which are necessary to improve the quality of social exchanges. this focus on intentional work design as means to improve lmx and tmx relationships would not necessarily replace needed training on techniques such as interpersonal skills. however work design and employer attention to the social aspects of work and in particular the increasing importance of teams may foster more effective work environments. fourth our findings that tmx relates positively with job performance job satisfaction organizational commit ment and turnover yet only increments lmx for organizational commitment and job satisfaction are important for practitioners. time is finite resource for those ged in business. thus organizations wish to be as efficient as possible with the time allotted to training and other interventions. for this reason if choice must be made in allocating time between tmx-related and lmx-related interventions those employees diagnosed with commitment and satisfaction issues may be best served by training related to both constructs. for those diagnosed with job performance issues and the intention to turnover under tight time constraints interventions should focus primarily on lmx-related skills. limitations and future directions as with most meta-analyses limitation of this work derives from shortcomings in the primary studies we reviewed. first too few studies of group-level factors in relation to tmx currently exist for examining how relational interactions among peer coworkers shape the characteristic nature of teams even as no team has unique nature apart from such interactions. moroup-level studies are needed and especially studies that investigate how working relationships facilitate cooperation coordination and performance at the team level. longitudinal studies would be most helpful in this respect. second basic reporting issues limited the ability to explore moderators such as average team tenure and average number of participants per team. for instance higher average team tenure may result in higher levels of tmx as it can take time for such relationships to develop. relatively speaking lmx relationships with one individual may develop more quickly than tmx with multiple team members. the total number of participants per team may also play an important role. for example larger teams may make it more difficult for subordinate to develop high-quality exchange relationships with the leader as the leader likely has to attend to many more members. lmx is founded on the notion that leaders develop exchange relationships of different quality. better reporting practices in primary studies would allow for the testing of such moderating constructs. another potential moderator of the relative importance of lmx quality compared with tmx would be the extent to which team has work autonomy from supervisor. teams with more autonomy undoubtedly require less interaction with leader and may ge in leadership behaviors within the team. furthermore the need to develop high-quality lmx relationships will be attenuated as leaders will be less likely to control pertinent information and resources. therefore future research should attempt to operationally define and measure the extent of team autonomy in order to evaluate its moderating influence. additionally future studies should indicate when team leaders are considered team members when measuring tmx. because of their status leaders are highly salient group members making them highly influential team members. it is possible that leader inclusion has an effect on tmx ratings by team members. for this reason future research should investigate team leader inclusion as moderator. third differentiation has also been considered as an important factor when exploring lmx within work groups but not enough primary studies currently exist to incorporate it into metaanalysis. differentiation is characterized by the extent of quality variability in lmx and tmx relationships. previous research has demonstrated that lmx differentiation attenuated the value of lmx quality while it augmented the value of tmx quality on self-efficacy and creativity. thus more studies should investigate differentiation as an important construct to be considered. additionally we know of only one study an unpublished team and leader exchange copyright john wiley sons ltd.. organiz. behav.  doi. job doctoral dissertation that has attempted to directly compare dyadic peer aggregation with tmx but publishable research comparing tmx with dyadic peer analysis remains an important gap in the literature. finally further studies are needed for better understanding other outcomes such as citizenship behaviors and coun terproductive work behavior as well as team-focused outcomes including team cohesiveness and team performance. it is likely that the relative importance of tmx compared with lmx is greater in work situations in which success is contingent upon strong social exchange relationships between team members. furthermore perceived organizational support should also be considered in future research. unfortunately the number of samples with pos was too small to include in this meta-analytic review. individuals have somewhat affiliative relationship to the employing organization as psychological object. eisenbr huntington hutchison and sowa based their proposal of the pos construct on levinson observation that individuals personify their employing organization viewing actions by organizational agents as actions of the organization itself. this personification is integral to an employee sense of psychological contract as reciprocal exchange relationship with the organization. posmay complement lmx and tmx or it may provide redundant information. thus future research should consider the relative wt of pos as well as the potential incremental validity above and beyond lmx and tmx. conclusion the use of teams within firms has continued to increase over recent decades in order to better capitalize on the synst effects of collaboration. the results of this study provide mixed evidence for the contribution of tmx compared with lmx when predicting outcomes in the workplace. tmx did demonstrate incremental validity and moderate relative contribution when predicting organizational commitment and job satisfaction but tmx added little value when predicting job performance and turnover intentions. research on tmx continues to increase. yet re-focused research agenda that includes better reporting practices the inclusion of theoretically meaningful moderators and broader range of outcomes is needed. thus while it appears that tmx adds value in predicting some outcomes more research is needed in order to identify under differing conditions the relative and unique contributions of tmx and lmx quality within work groups. acknowlment suggestions by michael. mcdaniel were valuable in
