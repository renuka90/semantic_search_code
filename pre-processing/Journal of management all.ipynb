The second model takes as its unit of\\nanalysis the firm’s top management team (TMT), construed as a dominant coalition that shares\\nresponsibility for decision making (e.g., Hambrick & Mason, 1984). This TMT model is seen\\nin the literatures on TMT conflict, TMT consensus, strategic decision aids, and TMT demo-\\ngraphics, among others (e.g., Dooley & Fryxell, 1999; Homburg, Krohmer, & Workman,\\n1999; Schweiger, Sandberg, & Ragan, 1986). Each model has expanded our knowledge of\\nstrategic decision making.\\n\\nSerious questions abound, however, about the representativeness of these two models,\\nespecially when they are construed as anchor points on a strategic decision-making contin-\\nuum. To the extent that the CEO model focuses on CEOs as lone decision makers, perhaps by\\nexamining the actions of the CEO alone when considering a strategic decision, the CEO model\\nis an “atomized, undersocialized conception of human action” (Granovetter, 1985: 483) that\\nneglects the CEO’s social context. Such “lone ranger” CEOs would wield their power and\\nmake unilateral decisions, despite being boundedly rational and despite needing to address\\nmultiple, conflicting goals and evaluate myriad options (Cyert & March, 1963). These quali-\\nties, along with the ambiguous nature of strategic decisions, likely limit the extent to which\\nmany CEOs will choose to be “lone rangers” and make strategic decisions single-handedly\\n(Garten, 2001).\\n\\nSimilarly, to the extent that it implies collective decision making, the TMT model likely\\napplies to a relatively small percentage of firms. As described, the model is an “oversocialized\\nconception” (Granovetter, 1985: 485) that does not recognize that TMTs tend to be hierarchi-\\ncal decision-making bodies (Hollenbeck et al., 1995) in which involvement is not equal but,\\nrather, is driven by the influence of advisory systems within and outside the firm. The distrib-\\nuted expertise of TMT members (Hollenbeck et al., 1995), control of resources (Finkelstein,\\n1992), intrafirm coalitions (Eisenhardt & Bourgeois, 1988), and information asymmetries\\n(Edmondson, Roberto, & Watkins, 2003), for example, may hinder equal decision participa-\\ntion by a firm’s top managers or may presage adverse decisions when a firm’s top managers do\\nparticipate equally.\\n\\nThese factors have raised questions about whether many TMTs should be studied as\\n“teams” at all (see, e.g., Hambrick, 1994, 1995; Pettigrew, 1992) and whether strategic deci-\\nsions for many firms are made following the team structures and processes implied by an\\noversocialized TMT model. Many scholars (e.g., Carpenter, Geletkanycz, & Sanders, 2004;\\nHambrick, 1994, 1998; Roberto, 2003) have questioned the notion of a stable TMT that col-\\nlectively makes a range of strategic decisions and have proposed alternatives to the collective\\nTMT model. Hambrick (1994, 1998), for example, suggested that TMTs may be characterized\\nby their behavioral integration, defined as the “degree to which the senior management group\\nengages in mutual and collective interaction” (Hambrick, 1998: 127). Shifting away from\\nbehavioral descriptions of a stable TMT, Roberto (2003) proposed a fluid form of TMT, one in\\nwhich different executives come together to work on different issues. In addition to suggesting\\nthat strategic decision making tends to involve both a “stable core and dynamic periphery” of\\ntop-level executives, Roberto also noted the involvement of “individuals from multiple orga-\\nnizational levels” (2003: 127). Consistent with these observations, Pettigrew (1992) recom-\\nmended that the nature of the research question influences the chosen unit of analysis (e.g., all\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 681\\n\\n\\n\\ntop-level executives vs. those involved in a given decision). Likewise, Carpenter and his col-\\nleagues have argued that “while use of a team-based approach (to empirical study) is appropri-\\nate to some questions . . . , team aggregation is not universally advisable” (2004: 769).\\n\\nAlthough the strategic decision-making process for some decisions in some firms may con-\\nform to either the CEO or the TMT model, we suggest that many strategic decisions in many\\nfirms are made neither by a unilateral CEO nor by a TMT. Research into the social networks of\\nTMTs (e.g., Collins & Clark, 2003) and into the varying composition of strategic decision-\\nmaking groups (e.g., Roberto, 2003) suggests the need for a third structural model of strategic\\ndecision making. Thus, we propose the CEO-Adviser model, which blends individual and\\ngroup decision making. The CEO-Adviser model recognizes that individuals involved in stra-\\ntegic decision making may come from anywhere in the firm’s hierarchy and may not be con-\\nsulted on all decisions, in line with Roberto’s (2003) “stable core and dynamic periphery.”\\nFurthermore, those involved in strategic decision making may include individuals from out-\\nside the firm, such as members of the CEO’s personal social network. In adding this third\\nmodel, we agree with Carpenter and his colleagues (2004: 769), who recommended “more\\nflexible” approaches to the question, “Who at the apex of the firm impacts organizational out-\\ncomes?” and who observed that “researchers’ focus should not be exclusively internal to firm\\nmanagement.” Such an approach does not negate the value of research conducted using either\\nthe CEO or TMT models but posits instead a third approach that might prove more authentic\\nfor a wide range of firms. For example, whereas TMT-based research by Michel and\\nHambrick (1992) demonstrates the links between TMT characteristics and firms’ diversifica-\\ntion posture, the same research from a CEO-Adviser perspective might produce a more\\nprecise model of diversification decision making.\\n\\nIn the next section, we briefly review some of the important contributions and limitations of\\nthe CEO and TMT models. Then, we detail the CEO-Adviser model and compare it to the oth-\\ners. Next, we develop a series of propositions to illustrate broadly how theory may benefit\\nfrom explicit inclusion of the CEO-Adviser model in the list of strategic decision-making\\nmodels. Throughout, we argue that this model accurately describes decision making in many\\nfirms. Finally, we discuss some implications for future research on strategic decision making.\\n\\nThree Models of Strategic Decision Making\\n\\nStrategic decisions are those highly important organizational choices that involve strategic\\npositioning, affect firm performance, involve multiple functions, are highly complex and\\nambiguous, and represent a substantial commitment of resources (Eisenhardt, 1989). Figure 1\\nprovides diagrams of the three strategic decision-making models discussed in this article: the\\nCEO model, the TMT model, and the CEO-Adviser model. We now discuss each in turn.\\n\\nThe CEO Model\\n\\nThe CEO is the strategic decision maker in this model. As depicted by the CEO model in\\nFigure 1, the CEO gathers and processes information, develops a strategy, and then directs\\nimplementation throughout the firm. Taken to an extreme, the CEO model may be considered\\n\\n682  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\n“execucentric,” in that its essence is what Swiercz and Ross labeled “an orientation that seems\\nunaware of the presence and legitimacy of organizational perspectives other than that of the\\nexecutive” (2003: 420). This model aligns with Vroom and Yetton’s (1973) two “autocratic”\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 683\\n\\nPanel a.

Still, visibility and celebrity are not the distinguishing facets of the CEO\\nmodel. Instead, this model is set apart by its focus on dominant individual decision makers at\\nthe apex of firms. Thus, the individualistic style of strategic decision making (see, e.g., Hay-\\nward & Westphal, 2002) likely occurs at lesser known firms as well, especially those led by\\nowner-managers.\\n\\nDo some CEOs really have this much influence? Probably. Power and accountability are\\nnot equally distributed among top managers (Finkelstein, 1992); often, the CEO retains the\\nlargest share of both (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Power differences are manifest in several\\nways. Although compensation differentials are pronounced between CEOs and their direct\\nreports (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996), many CEOs are “a breed apart” in other ways as well.\\nNorburn (1989), for example, found CEOs to be distinguished by their diverse experiences\\nand by their preparation to assume responsibility for complex and demanding operations. As\\none might expect, research has shown that CEOs’ activities, such as environmental scanning\\nand strategic decision making, do affect firm outcomes like structure and performance (Daft\\net al., 1988; Priem, 1994). Thus, there is empirical support for the descriptive accuracy of the\\nCEO model.\\n\\nThe ability of many CEOs to make effective strategic decisions single-handedly, however,\\nis hampered by CEOs’ bounded rationality (Cyert & March, 1963) and by the ambiguous\\nnature of strategic decisions (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Shifting to the other end of the deci-\\nsion-making continuum, the next section describes the TMT model, an accepted approach for\\nhelping boundedly rational CEOs make strategic decisions.\\n\\nThe TMT Model\\n\\nThe firm’s top managers are the strategic decision maker in the TMT model (Figure 1).\\nWhen viewed as a collective decision-making body, TMT members bring key information to\\nthe group, together develop and evaluate alternatives, resolve disagreements to reach consensus,\\nand jointly participate in implementing strategy. This version of the TMT model aligns with\\nthe most “democratic” decision-making style described by Vroom and Yetton (1973). Leaders\\nusing the “GII” style share problems with their followers as a group and solicit agreement.\\n\\nMuch upper echelons research appears to assume, explicitly or not, that this collective\\nTMT model either accurately describes firms’ current strategic decision-making processes or\\ndescribes what such processes should be for maximum effectiveness. This assertion is based\\non the many studies that rely equally on data from all members of the TMT, however defined\\n(e.g., Michel & Hambrick, 1992). Thus, and perhaps for reasons of empirical necessity, the\\nimage suggested by some scholars is one of collective effort, actual or idealized. Executive\\ngroups that do not observe team-oriented decision-making processes often are described as\\n“fragmented” (Hambrick, 1995) or as engaged in dysfunctional conflict (Eisenhardt,\\nKahwajy, & Bourgeois, 1997), which may indeed be the case.\\n\\nNot generally discussed is the possibility that, for some firms at least, the collective TMT\\nmodel of strategic decision making is neither descriptive nor desired. To be a “team,” a group is\\nexpected to have a relatively stable composition of individuals whose skills and abilities are\\n\\n684  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\nlinked to the team’s purposes and performance challenges. Many executive groups may not be\\nteams in this sense (Hambrick, 1994); they do not have a purpose distinct from the firm’s, and\\nthey may not hold their members mutually accountable for group outcomes (Cohen & Bailey,\\n1997). Many TMTs seem to do little collective work (Katzenbach, 1998). Although a “stable\\nsubset of the top team” (Roberto, 2003: 120) tends to be involved in making various strategic\\ndecisions, additional individuals from throughout the firm also are involved, depending on the\\nnature of the strategic decision and its attendant information and implementation needs\\n(Roberto, 2003). This lack of stability in form calls into question whether most TMTs—espe-\\ncially those subjected to typical empirical inquiry—satisfy the fundamental criteria for teams.\\nThis view is supported by many senior executives, whose responses, when asked about the\\nTMTs of which they are members, are similar to that of this executive vice president of\\nmarketing for a large firm:\\n\\nWhen I think of a team, I think of interaction, a lot of give-and-take, and shared purpose. In our\\ncompany, we’re a collection of strong players, but hardly a “team.” We rarely meet as a team—\\nrarely see each other, in fact. We don’t particularly share the same views. I wouldn’t say we actu-\\nally work at cross-purposes, but a lot of self-centered behavior occurs. Where’s the “team” in all\\nthis? (Hambrick, 1994: 172).\\n\\nIf many TMTs do not operate as unified collectives when making strategic decisions, if true\\ntop management “teams” are uncommon (Katzenbach, 1998), and if boundedly rational CEOs\\ncannot effectively make strategic decisions alone (Garten, 2001), then how do strategic deci-\\nsions get made? In the next section, we describe a third model that develops the “middle\\nground” between the CEO and TMT strategic decision–making models. Like the CEO and\\nTMT models, the proposed CEO-Adviser model attempts to describe who is involved with\\nstrategic decision making and how such decision making occurs.\\n\\nThe CEO-Adviser Model\\n\\nThis proposed model of strategic decision making is based on the Judge-Advisor model\\ndeveloped in the organizational behavior literature (Sniezek, 1999; Sniezek & Buckley, 1995;\\nSniezek & Van Swol, 2001). Represented by the CEO-Adviser model in Figure 1, the model’s\\ncharacteristics include the CEO as the principal decision maker, both internal and external\\nadvisers, CEO selection of advisers, and dyadic communication between the CEO and advis-\\ners. This model is similar to the “consultative” decision-making styles described by Vroom\\nand Yetton (1973). Both the CI and CII decision-making styles involve leaders listening to fol-\\nlowers’ideas and then making decisions alone. Likewise, in the CEO-Adviser model, the CEO\\nsolicits information yet “holds ultimate authority for the final decision, and is made account-\\nable for it” (Sniezek, 1999: 1). The CEO-Adviser model also involves a complex social infor-\\nmation search to identify strategic advisers and considerable CEO-Adviser trust and collabo-\\nration. Thus, the CEO-Adviser model is an intermediate model of strategic decision making.\\n\\nFoundations of the CEO-Adviser model. The Judge-Advisor model was developed to “pro-\\nvide more ecologically valid representations of the decision process as it occurs in the natural\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 685\\n\\n\\n\\nenvironments of decision makers” (Sniezek, 1999: 1). According to Sniezek and Buckley\\n(1995), decision making cannot be understood adequately using extant research on either indi-\\nviduals or groups because decision making often involves multiple people whose participa-\\ntion is differentiated, rather than coequal. Thus, there is a need for a model in which individual\\ndecision makers consult with, and receive information from, others (individually or in groups)\\nwhen faced with important decisions under uncertainty (Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001).\\n\\nWe have changed the model’s name to CEO-Adviser decision making for two reasons.\\nFirst, the “Judge” label might cause unintended confusion with a courtlike setting. Although\\nCEO-Adviser decision making can involve advocacy and interadviser conflict, neither is\\nessential to the model. Second, the CEO-Adviser model is constrained to addressing strategic\\ndecision making. In general, the characteristics of CEO-Adviser participants (e.g., their areas\\nof expertise) vary from those of the broader population. For example, CEOs tend to be better\\nprepared to assume responsibility for complex operations than do other managers (Norburn,\\n1989). Thus, despite its roots in the Judge-Advisor model, we expect the uniqueness of the\\ndecision makers, advisers, and the decisions themselves to result in a unique CEO-Adviser\\nmodel. Beyond Sniezek’s (1999) work, the foundation for the CEO-Adviser model rests in\\nfour assertions central to the management literature.\\n\\nFirst, CEOs are ultimately responsible for their firm’s strategic decision making and are\\naccountable for its outcomes (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996). As the most powerful individu-\\nals in their firms, CEOs influence learning (Vera & Crossan, 2004), strategic and symbolic\\nactivities within the firm (Hambrick & Pettigrew, 2001), member commitment to implement-\\ning strategic decisions (Goodwin, Wofford, & Whittington, 2001), and firm performance\\n(Waldman, Javidan, & Varella, 2004). Research has shown that in addition to CEOs having\\npower over strategic decision making, their leadership style (e.g., transactional vs.\\ntransformational) significantly affects the implementation of strategic decisions and their\\noutcomes (e.g., Howell & Avolio, 1993).\\n\\nSecond, strategic decision making is characterized by ambiguity and complexity (Carpen-\\nter & Fredrickson, 2001; Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996; Kotter, 1982). Decision makers are\\ncompelled to use incomplete information to make key decisions that affect the firm’s future\\nand that involve substantial resources (Mintzberg, Raisinghani, & Theoret, 1976). In addition,\\nmany firms may be described as “organized anarchies” (Cohen, March, & Olsen, 1972) in\\nwhich decision making is plagued by shifting preferences, unclear technology, and fluid partici-\\npation. These attributes can render optimizing decision making problematic, if not impossible.\\n\\nThird, there is high potential for information overload (Cyert & March, 1963; Kotter, 1982)\\nor overreliance on extant mental maps. The amount and type of information processed from a\\nfirm’s environment (e.g., from suppliers and competitors) is likely too great for any one per-\\nson, especially as information technology makes more information available more quickly.\\nSuch information overload compels the involvement in decision making of many individuals,\\neach of whom processes different sources of information. If involvement were restricted to the\\nfirm’s top executives, one could expect reliance on a dominant logic that may not serve the\\nfirm well as its environment shifts (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986). At the level of strategic deci-\\nsions, then, decision-making involvement comes in the form of advice and consultation between\\nthe CEO and advisers, who may or may not be members of the TMT (Roberto, 2003) or of\\nthe firm.\\n\\n686  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\nFourth, there is evidence that top managers rely on advice from social networks that include\\nfriends, suppliers, customers, financial institutions, alliance partners, trade associations, and\\nothers (Collins & Clark, 2003; Gabarro, 1987). Some research suggests that CEOs may rely\\nmore on advice gained from personal connections than from formal advisory systems (Brown\\n& Eisenhardt, 1995; Elenkov, 1997; McDonald & Westphal, 2003). Moreover, Eisenhardt\\n(1989) has found evidence of CEOs seeking the advice of “wise counselors” over a range of\\nstrategic decisions, and Roberto (2003) has reported that CEOs often rely on a core group for\\nmaking decisions. Likewise, the business press has reported instances of CEOs seeking guid-\\nance from outsiders, such as General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt soliciting advice from Warren\\nBuffett (Serwer, 2003). As suggested by Kets de Vries, “Frank feedback from outsiders such\\nas external directors, bankers, and consultants” can help leaders stay “in touch with reality”\\n(1989: 15). Together, these four factors provide a foundation for the CEO-Adviser model\\nbased in the strategic management literature.\\n\\nFactors Influencing the Use of the CEO-Adviser Model\\n\\nIn this section, we build on our four-factor foundation and develop several propositions\\nintended to illustrate the potential of the CEO-Adviser model. These propositions are intended\\nto be representative, rather than exhaustive, of how the CEO-Adviser model might contribute\\nto our understanding of strategic decision making. The propositions are arranged to reflect an\\n“outside-in, macro-to-micro” approach to understanding CEO-Adviser strategic decision\\nmaking. Thus, we start by considering the impact of the environment (outside) and then move\\ninside the firm to consider the impact of the firm’s strategy (macro), followed by the character-\\nistics of the CEO and his or her selection of advisers (micro). In taking this approach, our\\nintent is to identify some key situational factors expected to affect the prevalence of the CEO-\\nAdviser model.\\n\\nEnvironmental Dynamism\\n\\nThe external environment is an important contingency factor for strategic decision making\\n(e.g., Dess & Beard, 1984; Eisenhardt, 1989). CEOs need to acquire and interpret information\\nfrom their environment to make and implement strategic decisions. As environments change,\\nfirms have to adapt to these changes. Dynamic external environments are characterized by a\\nhigh rate of change, absence of pattern, and unpredictability (Priem, Rasheed, & Kotulic,\\n1995). The more dynamic the environment, the greater the uncertainty and the greater the\\ninformation-processing and decision-making demands placed on a firm’s strategic decision\\nmakers (Kotter, 1982).\\n\\nScanning of the external environment, however, represents only the first link in the series of\\nactivities needed to acquire the information needed for strategic decision making in dynamic\\nenvironments (Daft et al., 1988). CEOs need to interpret the information and understand its\\nimplications. This entails having richer and more detailed information about the changes in\\nthe environment, their implications, and feasible alternatives (Kraatz, 1998).\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 687\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, although CEOs use both internal and external sources of information in strategic\\ndecision making, as the dynamism of the environment increases, CEOs will tend to prefer\\nexternal sources (i.e., those comprising the informal advisory system). Obtaining data directly\\nfrom the environment ensures that it is undiluted with no loss of meaning (Daft et al., 1988).\\nIndeed, seeking unvarnished counsel from individuals within the formal advisory system may\\nbe complicated by the fact that some viable, or even necessary, strategic alternatives may\\nrequire sacrifices from those individuals and their subordinates, a potential precursor to low\\ngoal congruence (Yukl & Fu, 1999). In addition, information from within the firm tends to be\\nbiased, distorted, and slow as it progresses up the organizational hierarchy (Daft & Lengel,\\n1986).\\n\\nIn contrast, more stable external environments create less uncertainty and thus require less\\ninformation search and less interaction with knowledgeable outsiders (Haleblian &\\nFinkelstein, 1993; Kotter, 1982). Information-processing requirements for decision making\\nare low in stable environments. Stable environments promote more internally focused behav-\\nior and increase the likelihood that competent firm insiders who comprise the formal advisory\\nsystem will have the opportunity to give advice (Yukl & Fu, 1999). With stability comes the\\npromise of continued individual and departmental support from the firm, so there may be less\\nreason for the leader to question the motives and consequent objectivity of internal\\ninformation sources. Thus,\\n\\nProposition 1: As environmental dynamism increases, CEOs will be more likely to rely on informal\\nadvisory systems for information and advice in making strategic decisions.\\n\\nOrganizational Strategy\\n\\nCEOs’ more fine-grained patterns of social information search also may be quite different\\nfor firms pursuing different business-level strategies. Porter (1980) asserted, for example, that\\nfirm success requires attention to distinctive competencies and that these competencies differ\\nfor the business-level strategies of cost leadership and differentiation.\\n\\nFirms pursuing cost leadership require close attention to cost controls, detailed control\\nreports, structured responsibilities, and incentives based on quantitative targets (Porter, 1980).\\nSimilarly, Miles and Snow’s defenders engage in minimal new market or product develop-\\nment, want to preserve their market share, and seek stability (Miles & Snow, 1978). In essence,\\nfirms pursuing either cost leadership or defender strategies tend to emphasize firm efficiency\\n(Miller, 1987). Therefore, most of the strategic decision maker’s attention in firms pursuing\\ncost leadership or defender strategies will focus on internal operations. Such efficiency-\\nfocused strategies are most successful when implemented through mechanistic structures with\\nformal controls (Kotha & Orne, 1989; Priem & Rosenstein, 2000). Specifically, the formal\\nadvisory systems within these firms are expected to obtain information from the environment\\n(e.g., from the political/legal sector) and to provide counsel to the CEO on strategic decisions.\\n\\nFirms pursuing differentiation, in contrast, need coordination among functions, subjective\\nmeasurement and incentives, and amenities to attract highly skilled employees (Porter, 1980).\\nLikewise, prospectors aggressively seek new market opportunities and take risks (Miles &\\n\\n688  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\nSnow, 1978). These firms survive by virtue of ongoing communication with the external\\nworld. Because their competitive advantage arises largely from new products and services,\\ntheir CEOs are likely to focus on relationships with the environment, especially the customer\\nand technology sectors. Empirical research linking managers’functional experience and busi-\\nness-level strategy (e.g., Govindarajan, 1989) and empirical research linking business strategy\\nto the areas emphasized in CEO scanning (Garg, Walters, & Priem, 2003) argue that CEOs\\nwill seek information from individuals whose knowledge most closely reflects the sources of\\ncore competence for their firm.\\n\\nMiles and Snow’s prospectors and Porter’s differentiators emphasize innovation (Miller,\\n1987). Miller (1987) described these firms as complex innovators that strive to capitalize on\\nnovel opportunities in the marketplace, supported by their use of organic structures. These\\nstructures include informal and continuous scanning of the environment and multiplexity (i.e.,\\nuse of diverse viewpoints in decision making). CEOs of firms emphasizing innovation use\\ntheir informal advisory network to get real-time and diverse information on the environment.\\nDoing so helps to minimize the potentially negative effects of, and possibly alters, the extant\\ndominant logic of the TMT that might otherwise hinder innovation (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986).\\n\\nThese arguments are consistent with contingency theory (e.g., Kotha & Orne, 1989), which\\nproposes higher performance for firms that align their strategy and structure. Thus,\\n\\nProposition 2a: CEOs of organizations pursuing cost leadership and defender strategies will tend to\\nrely more on their organizations’ formal advisory systems for information and advice in making\\nstrategic decisions.\\n\\nProposition 2b: CEOs of organizations pursuing differentiation and prospector strategies will tend to\\nrely more on an informal advisory system for information and advice in making strategic\\ndecisions.\\n\\nCEO Leadership Style\\n\\nBeyond influencing their firms through their judgment in strategic decisions (Hambrick &\\nMason, 1984), CEOs also influence their firms “through their ability to organize, or their cha-\\nrisma, or their skill in delegation” (Priem, 1994: 421). Finkelstein and Hambrick (1996)\\nargued that leadership styles influence strategic decisions by affecting CEOs’ fields of vision,\\nperceptions, and interpretations of information. To the extent that the leadership style of CEOs\\naffects implementation of strategic decisions (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996), we would\\nexpect strategic decision-making preference to be related to leadership style. The two main\\nleadership styles are transformational and transactional (Bass, 1985).\\n\\nTransformational leadership creates “a dynamic organizational vision that often necessi-\\ntates a metamorphosis in cultural values to reflect greater innovation” (Pawar & Eastman,\\n1997: 83). We expect transformational CEOs to rely more on their informal advisory system\\nfor two reasons. First, the contextual factors that create the need for transformational leader-\\nship also increase the need for informal advisers. Relevant firm-based factors include the need\\nfor adaptation, dominance of boundary-spanning units, a simple and adhocratic structure, and\\nclan mode of governance (Pawar & Eastman, 1997). Such firms need real-time information on\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 689\\n\\n\\n\\nthe environment. Transformational leaders are more likely to find success in firms experienc-\\ning a need to break away from the status quo in search of a new direction (Bass, 1985), render-\\ning obsolete many internal processes. Together, these factors will lead a CEO to rely on\\ninformal networks outside the firm.\\n\\nSecond, the personality characteristics of transformational CEOs likely cause them to be\\nmore attracted to informal advisory systems. Judge and Bono (2000) found agreeableness,\\nextraversion, and openness to experience to be personality traits of transformational leaders.\\nThese leaders dominate socially through dialogue and social interaction. They are charis-\\nmatic, inspirational, intellectually stimulating (Bass, 1985) and seek new opportunities\\n(Lowe, Kroeck, & Sivasubramaniam, 1996). They are neither rigid nor prone to use formal\\nstructures; rather, they are unconventional innovators (Conger & Kanungo, 1988). These\\ncharacteristics will lead a CEO to rely more on informal networks outside the firm when\\nmaking strategic decisions.\\n\\nConversely, the context that accommodates transactional leadership, combined with the\\npersonality traits of transactional leaders, make these leaders more prone to use their firm’s\\nformal advisory system. Transactional leaders are likely to emerge in firms with an emphasis\\non efficiency, dominance of a technocratic core, a professional bureaucracy, and bureaucratic\\nmodes of governance (Pawar & Eastman, 1997). Transactional leaders use contingent reward\\nsystems within established systems to reinforce existing structures, strategies, and culture\\n(Waldman, Ramirez, House, & Puranam, 2001). As such, transactional leaders are more likely\\nto emerge in mechanistic organizations (Bass, 1985) that have a high need for efficiency and\\ninternal information to maintain controls. Such firms use bureaucracy to substitute personal\\ninfluence with formal policies and procedures (House, Spangler, & Woycke, 1991). As a\\nresult, CEOs will have less discretion and will rely on the firm’s formal advisory system. Thus,\\n\\nProposition 3a: The more transformational the CEO’s leadership style, the more likely the CEO will\\nrely on an informal advisory system for information and advice in making strategic decisions.\\n\\nProposition 3b: The more transactional the CEO’s leadership style, the more likely the CEO will rely\\non a formal advisory system for information and advice in making strategic decisions.\\n\\nCEO Tenure\\n\\nStrategic decision making entails making consequential decisions, and taking responsibil-\\nity, while relying on information and advice from others. CEOs’ knowledge of their informal\\nadvisers and of the individuals within their firms’ formal advisory systems would seem to\\ninfluence their relative reliance on information and advice from these sources. This introduces\\nissues of trust and confidence in adviser expertise and knowledge (Sniezek & Van Swol,\\n2001). We suggest that a CEO’s tenure in the position influences his or her knowledge of, and\\ntrust in, both informal and formal advisory systems.\\n\\nWhen CEOs are new to their positions, they may not know about or trust the knowledge,\\nmotives, or expertise of many individuals within the firm’s formal advisory system. This will\\nbe especially true for newcomers to both the firm and position. In fact, the preference of a\\nboard for an outsider as the new CEO likely suggests to the newcomer a possible lack of confi-\\n\\n690  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\ndence in the firm’s existing upper echelons. In addition, because other top executives might\\nfeel slighted by not having been promoted to the “top job,” they may not be committed to the\\nsuccess of the new CEO. This latter situation may occur even in the case of insider succession.\\nShort-tenured CEOs, therefore, need time to build understanding of their firms (Gabarro,\\n1987). While newcomers to both the firm and position will need time to build an understand-\\ning “from the ground up,” those promoted from within will need time to build an understand-\\ning of the firm’s altered power and information structure (Kets de Vries, 1989). As such, new\\nCEOs (regardless of origin) will likely rely on fewer individuals in the firm’s formal advisory\\nsystem when they first “take charge” (e.g., within the initial 6 months to about 2 years) com-\\npared to when they are more established (Eisenhardt, 1989; Gabarro, 1987; Hambrick &\\nFukutomi, 1991; Kotter, 1982).\\n\\nDuring the period in which new CEOs develop trust in their organizations’ formal advisory\\nsystems, they rely more on their informal advisory system for information and expertise\\n(Aguilar, 1967). For short-tenured CEOs, the process of testing the formal advisory system\\nlikely includes aggressive gathering and assessing information by asking questions on a con-\\ntinuous basis (Gabarro, 1987; Kotter, 1982). Building an in-group of internal advisers takes\\ntime, as individuals are tested and found knowledgeable, credible, and loyal (Graen & Uhl-\\nBien, 1995). This will be the case no matter the CEO’s origin, inside or outside. In addition,\\nCEOs will have the opportunity over time to hire trusted and informal advisers into their new\\norganization—perhaps as senior executives or as members of the board. It is not surprising,\\ntherefore, that the appointment of a new outsider CEO is usually followed shortly by the exo-\\ndus and replacement of some of the incumbent top executives of the firm (Pitcher, Chreim, &\\nKisfalvi, 2000).\\n\\nConversely, longer tenured CEOs have had the opportunity to evaluate and form opinions\\nabout the trustworthiness and expertise of individuals within their firm’s formal advisory sys-\\ntem. They have had the opportunity to replace those found incompetent or untrustworthy with\\nindividuals (usually from their informal advisory system) they trust. As a result, longer ten-\\nured CEOs can be expected to rely more on the firm’s formal advisory system (Aguilar, 1967).\\nThus,\\n\\nProposition 4: The longer a CEO’s tenure in the position, the more a CEO will tend to rely on the orga-\\nnization’s formal advisory system for information and advice in making strategic decisions.\\n\\nAdviser Selection\\n\\nThus far, we have discussed several factors expected to influence a CEO’s tendency toward\\nrelying on an informal advisory system or the organization’s formal advisory system. Not yet\\ndiscussed are any factors that might be expected to influence which individuals within these\\nsystems might be relied on as advisers for strategic decision making. Although a variety of\\nfactors might be considered, in this article, we focus on the nature of the interactions between\\nCEOs and their advisers. Dyadic communication provides a medium for social information\\nsearch and CEO-Adviser collaboration and interaction. Unlike the more formal and pre-\\nscribed interactions between CEOs and their subordinates (including top managers), the inter-\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 691\\n\\n\\n\\nactions between CEOs and their advisers are often informal and based on their interpersonal\\nrelationships. Thus, communication and collaboration between a CEO and each adviser relies\\nprimarily on the bilateral or dyadic network ties existing between the two. The source of these\\nbilateral network ties is the social network of a CEO, defined as the system of relationships\\nwith actors both inside and outside the firm who provide the CEO with information and advice\\nand who may be in a position to influence the CEO with respect to strategic decision making\\n(Collins & Clark, 2003).\\n\\nThe importance of dyadic interaction in the CEO-Adviser model raises questions about the\\ntype of network ties that are optimal for strategic decision making: weak versus strong. First,\\nthe weak-ties argument (Granovetter, 1983) suggests that distant and infrequent communica-\\ntion between disconnected individuals provides new and useful information and is more effi-\\ncient for knowledge sharing. Furthermore, having ties with demographically heterogeneous\\nindividuals generates a wider variety of ideas (Granovetter, 1983), thereby enhancing creative\\naction (Bantel & Jackson, 1989). Thus, CEOs having advisers with whom they have heteroge-\\nneous and weak ties benefit by gaining access to novel information sets, insights, and ideas\\n(Kraatz, 1998).\\n\\nThe alternative argument asserts the importance of strong ties in facilitating network com-\\nmunication. Strong or cohesive ties promote trust and cooperation (Coleman, 1988). Such ties\\nare characterized by frequent interaction, an extended history, and “mutual confiding” between\\nthe focal individuals (Granovetter, 1983). Individuals belonging to a leader’s in-group likely\\nshare cohesive ties with their leader (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Tight coupling between indi-\\nviduals leads them to identify more with each other, enhancing collaboration and promoting\\nefficient knowledge sharing (Hansen, 1999). Hence, CEOs having advisers connected by\\nstrong ties should have in-depth communication and information exchange (Kraatz, 1998).\\n\\nThese arguments each provide explanations for the value derived from the respective types\\nof network ties. For the CEO-Adviser model, we believe that CEOs are more likely to be influ-\\nenced by, and to seek advice from, individuals with whom they share strong ties. First, when\\nmaking strategic decisions, CEOs need more than the novel ideas provided by those with\\nwhom they have weak ties. Strategic decision making entails the use of detailed and rich infor-\\nmation about alternatives, implications, desirability, and feasibility (Kraatz, 1998). The depth\\nof communication and level of interaction needed to provide such information and to test the\\nveracity and utility of such information are more likely associated with individuals with whom\\nthe CEO has strong ties. Frequent dyadic interaction between CEOs and individuals with\\nwhom they have strong ties facilitates the transfer and evaluation of sensitive and complex\\ninformation. Such tight coupling creates more efficient knowledge sharing (Hansen, 1999).\\n\\nSecond, compounding the ambiguity and complexity inherent in strategic decision making\\n(Carpenter & Fredrickson, 2001) is the “social uncertainty” present when a CEO has to rely on\\ninformation provided by another individual. Social uncertainty refers to the inability to predict\\naccurately another person’s behavior or the underlying motivations (Sniezek & Van Swol,\\n2001). By definition, a CEO who needs the counsel of an adviser either does not have all the\\ninformation to make a decision or lacks the expertise to analyze adequately that information.\\nThus, there is some information asymmetry between CEOs and advisers, and even with\\ndetailed explanation, the CEO cannot eliminate all uncertainty that the adviser is giving either\\naccurate information or the best possible advice (Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001). Hence,\\n\\n692  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\nProposition 5: In choosing advisers from their social networks, CEOs are more likely to rely on indi-\\nviduals with whom they have strong ties rather than on individuals with whom they have weak ties\\nfor information and advice in making strategic decisions.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nOur propositions have focused on identifying factors that contribute to relatively more or\\nless use by CEOs of informal versus formal advisory systems and the type of ties CEOs are\\nlikely to have with their advisers. Yet, clearly there are many other issues raised by the CEO-\\nAdviser model that we have not discussed. These include questions of information asymmetry\\nbetween CEOs and their advisers, communication with advisers individually versus in groups,\\nthe size of the adviser network, and how some advisers become especially relied on. Addi-\\ntional questions include how advisers are selected and evaluated by CEOs, how the type of\\ndecision affects the CEO’s selection of advisers, how CEOs might be led astray by advisers,\\nand finally, how factors such as these are related to the quality of strategic decisions. Next, we\\ndiscuss some specific directions for future research.\\n\\nFirst, research that explicitly examines the CEO-Adviser model in combination with the\\nCEO model or the TMT model may lead to enhanced scholarly understanding of the processes\\nof strategic decision making. For example, what are the contingency factors (or the configura-\\ntions of factors) that lead each model—CEO, CEO-Adviser, and TMT—to yield better organi-\\nzational performance? In addition, what contingencies (if any) lead to more effective imple-\\nmentation of strategic decisions made by the various models within the organization?\\nFurthermore, by formally developing a model to examine the “middle ground” between the\\nCEO and TMT models, future research can reopen questions previously explored using the\\nCEO or TMT models, such as the influence of CEO and TMT characteristics (e.g., tenure,\\nfunctional background) on strategic decision-making dynamics and outcomes (e.g., Michel &\\nHambrick, 1992). Ultimately, such reexaminations should yield increasingly accurate\\ndescriptions of the strategic decision-making process and outcomes in organizations. As stra-\\ntegic decision processes continue to be unbundled and the contents of the “black box” (Law-\\nrence, 1997) are revealed, researchers will be better positioned to address questions aimed at\\nimproving strategic decision making.\\n\\nIn addition, the CEO-Adviser model may facilitate finer-grained investigations into top\\nmanagers’ strategic decision-making processes by addressing questions such as, Who is\\ninvolved in various strategic decisions? How is their involvement determined? What are the\\nconsequences of their participation on decision quality? By what process does a CEO select\\nadvisers? When do advisers “select” CEOs? How does a CEO probe advisers and determine\\nthe value of their inputs? How does a CEO determine whether an adviser’s agenda is consis-\\ntent with the CEO’s agenda and with desired organizational outcomes? and How does a CEO\\ninterpret and combine advisers’ inputs to reach a strategic decision? The answers to these and\\nmany other decision process questions should expand our understanding of the strategic deci-\\nsion-making process and enhance our ability to recommend improvements to firms’ existing\\ndecision processes. Questions such as these have clear normative implications for practitio-\\nners wanting to choose the most advantageous decision-making approach given different task\\nand environmental conditions.\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 693\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also potential for integrating and extending currently disparate areas of research\\nunder the CEO-Adviser model. Mintzberg (1973) has noted, for example, that CEOs prefer\\nface-to-face contact when they gather information. This likely applies also to their use of dif-\\nferent communication methods with different advisers in the CEO-Adviser model. This pro-\\nvides an opportunity to extend strategic decision-making research to include information\\ngathering such as CEO scanning. For example, what types of advisers are likely to be chosen\\nand relied on for information and advice in which environmental sectors, given different levels\\nof uncertainty and the severe limitations on a CEO’s time (e.g., Daft et al., 1988)?\\n\\nFinally, further extensions of the CEO-Adviser model may be possible with additional\\ninsights from other theories. Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory (Graen & Uhl-Bien,\\n1995), for example, could help us to understand the dyadic relationships between the CEO and\\neach adviser, plus how these relationships might affect the relationships among all of the\\nfirm’s senior executives. Similarly, the extensive research on feedback-seeking behavior\\ncould provide guidance for building further understanding of when, and from whom, CEOs\\nsolicit advice. Ashford, Blatt, and VandeWalle noted that “little attention has been given to the\\nfeedback-seeking dynamics of those at the top of an organization or unit” (2003: 788). They\\nargued that those occupying the highest levels in a hierarchy likely receive less spontaneous\\nfeedback from others and, thus, have a greater instrumental need to seek feedback proactively.\\nMoreover, high contextual uncertainty—almost universal for CEOs—also increases the\\ninstrumental motive for feedback seeking (Ashford & Cummings, 1985; Gupta,\\nGovindarajan, & Malhotra, 1999). Thus, proactive feedback seeking from trusted advisers\\ncould help CEOs validate their organizational vision and strategic goals (Ashford et al., 2003).\\nIn sum, the CEO-Adviser model offers a framework for examining not only the goal-oriented\\nfeedback-seeking behaviors of CEOs but also their decision-related information gathering\\nand exchange efforts.\\n\\nAlthough the CEO-Adviser model could enhance our understanding of strategic decision\\nmaking, it still falls prey to the problems that have plagued researchers wishing to test empiri-\\ncally theories pertaining to top executives. Limited access to CEOs and other top executives,\\nfor example, has restricted researchers’ ability to investigate top management issues. This\\nproblem is accentuated for the CEO-Adviser model, which focuses on the process of execu-\\ntive decision making. This process cannot be observed easily outside the executive suite. In\\nfact, many of the concepts central to the CEO-Adviser model—such as the choice of advisers\\nand CEO interaction with these advisers—can only be investigated with the active participa-\\ntion of the CEO and his or her advisers. This is unlike the CEO and TMT models, in which\\nsome of the proposed relationships can be tested using demographic proxies.\\n\\nThis does not imply, however, that the CEO-Adviser model cannot be empirically tested.\\nIntensive qualitative research, such as the case-based method proposed by Eisenhardt (1989),\\nmay be used to develop further the CEO-Adviser model. Researchers can focus on a single or\\nsmall sample of firms and intensively and actively observe the decision-making process. From\\nthis initial set of intensive studies, constructs and hypotheses may be developed that can then\\nbe empirically tested on larger samples. Initial case-based studies will be able to operationalize\\nsome of the key concepts of the CEO-Adviser model such that it may be measured with more\\nreadily available data.\\n\\n694  / October 2005\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond prying open the “black box” (Lawrence, 1997) of strategic decision making as it\\noccurs in most firms, the CEO-Adviser model also has some practical implications. It high-\\nlights the fact that not all models are equally applicable to all firms and that the decision-making\\nprocess differs across firms. The CEO model, for example, might most appropriately be\\nadopted by researchers when the firms to be studied are (a) relatively small in terms of either\\nsize or product/market scope, wherein even strategic decisions might be made based on one\\nperson’s perspective, and/or (b) relatively young, wherein an entrepreneurial CEO or owner-\\nmanager has yet to establish either a formal advisory system or an external network of trusted\\nassociates (Greiner, 1998; Nelson & Winter, 1982). Furthermore, to the extent that a relatively\\nlarge power differential exists between the CEO and other managers (Finkelstein, 1992) in\\nsuch relatively small and immature organizations, we expect the CEO model to be particularly\\ninformative.\\n\\nThe TMT model, on the other hand, might most appropriately be adopted by researchers\\nwhen the firms to be studied are (a) relatively large in terms of size and product/market scope,\\nwherein structural complexity compels decision making that depends on the diverse perspec-\\ntives of multiple organizational members, and/or (b) relatively mature, where decentralized\\noperations reflect on the overall organization’s reputation (Greiner, 1998). To the extent that a\\nrelatively small power differential exists between a CEO and the “coalition of top managers”\\nrepresenting the “range of managerial orientations” (Finkelstein, 1992: 505) in such relatively\\nlarge and mature organizations, we expect the TMT model to be particularly informative.\\n\\nAnecdotal evidence and scholarly reports, however, indicate that another decision-making\\nmodel, which we have labeled CEO-Adviser decision making, is widespread at strategic lev-\\nels in firms. Thus, the CEO-Adviser model is descriptively accurate in many—although not\\nall—strategic decision situations. The CEO-Adviser model might most appropriately be\\nadopted by researchers when the firms to be studied are (a) not so small that their strategic\\ndirection and operations can be established solely by an owner-manager and yet not so large\\nthat those reporting to the CEO see themselves as leading their own independent companies\\nwithin the firm, (b) producing multiple products or services in multiple geographic markets,\\nand (c) mature enough to have survived and expanded beyond the initial birth or entrepreneur-\\nial stage of their development (Greiner, 1998). To the extent that a moderate power differential\\nexists between the CEO and the firm’s top managers in these hybrid firms, where the overarch-\\ning organizational goal—growth—depends on accurately listening to internal and external\\nstakeholders, we expect the CEO-Adviser model to be particularly informative (Greiner,\\n1998).\\n\\nThe CEO and TMT models will continue to generate productive research on strategic deci-\\nsion making. We hope that the CEO-Adviser model will augment and complement these foun-\\ndations. We have described CEO-Adviser decision making as a constructive addition to strate-\\ngic decision-making research. Our proposed research agenda considers the context of adviser\\nselection and the advising process. Again, the propositions we offer are far from exhaustive,\\nand important theory may be built in other areas using the CEO-Adviser model. Moreover, we\\nhave suggested areas where other literatures could be integrated into and extend the CEO-\\nAdviser model. We hope that this article stimulates scholarly activity that further articulates\\nand tests our propositions, and develops new ones, under the CEO-Adviser model.\\n\\nArendt et al. / CEO-Adviser Model 695\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAguilar, F.

       "' . editorial february feldman i am delighted to introduce sage publications as the new publisher of the. as of january sage publications has taken over the production marketing and distribution of jom. as you can see there have been some style changes in the journal which we hope will increase its attractiveness to readers. sage publications will also begin some new marketing initiatives for jom and be working with the southern management association to streamline and improve our distribution system. there are no changes in submission guidelines or procedures for authors so from the perspective of prospective authors there will be no disruptions in the editorial review process at all. the year was great one for jom. we crossed the manuscript per year mark this past year and at the pace we are running so far this year we will almost certainly pass the manuscriptper year mark in. that will represent increase in submissions per year since took over as editor. at the same time we have kept our turnaround time on manuscripts down to an average of only calendar days and that average excludes all the manuscripts that are rejected without review. our fastest turnaround on new manuscript was only days and the longest was days no author has had to wait more than months for feedback. our acceptance rate is hovering around which ranks us among the most selective journals in our field. and despite that high selectivity jom continues to earn its well deserved reputation for providing authors with constructive and developmental feedback even in cases where we cannot accept an article for publication. this past year jom introduced the special theory issue and it has been very positively received by the readership. this past fall alone we had submissions for the upcoming special theory issue. even outside the submissions to the special theory issue jom is increasing its visibility as an outlet for first rate theoretical work. this past year we also saw dead even split in submissions from the micro and macro sides of the field. i m very pleased that jom is entering the ranks of first choice outlets among faculty in strategic management entrepreneurship and organization theory. jom s annual reviews also continue to be widely read and cited. this past year we had more than proposals for the annual review to be published in december. all these accomplishments would not be possible without the support and assistance of many other faculty members who give generously of their time and effort to make the journal success. at the top of my list of acknowledgments of course are my senior associate editors carol kulik and allen amason. at every step of the way carol and allen are thoroughly professional developmental with authors and timely with their feedback. also want to acknowledge all the contributions carol and allen make to the outreach activities of jom at both the academy of management meetings and at sma. because of the wide reach of the journal often call on them to help me represent jom at numerous doctoral consortia junior faculty consortia ask the editors panels research development workshops and other preconference meetings. they re always willing to help out and do so enthusiastically.  vol.  no.  february doi .  southern management association there are many behind the scenes people who also keep the trains running. misty pierce our editorial assistant keeps on top of getting the manuscripts out for review getting our decision letters back to authors and keeping tight rein on reviewers. terri scandura the president of sma has given countless hours to working on the transition to new publishers so that jom could get the best production marketing and distribution support possible. tim barnett and allison pearson as treasurer and secretary of sma are both very quick and very gracious in taking care of the myriad financial and administrative details associated with running this enterprise. last but not least want to acknowledge the wonderful help get from the editorial review board. as we all know service to the profession tends to weight relatively low in universities annual performance review systems yet the members of the editorial review board regularly provide timely constructive and thoughtful reviews of manuscripts to their colleagues for very little tangible recompense. in many ways large and small they are the backbone of the journal and thank them for their generous contributions to jom s mission. this past year marked jom s th anniversary which was marked by celebrations and symposia at both the academy of management and sma. jom has become major outlet for disseminating firstrate scholarship in our field and i m confident even greater successes lay ahead in the next years. editor synovus chair of servant leadership university of georgia terry college athens ga february '"

active takeover market sparked considerable controversy. common strategic action taken managers even prior takeover bid adoption antitakeover provisions essentially involves company corporate charter operating policy makes takeover expensive. revival merger acquisition activity reactivated controversy additional adopting antitakeover provisions . moreover powerful shareholders pension funds increasingly challenging repeal antitakeover provisions adopted takeover wave . heart controversy surrounding antitakeover provisions whether provisions enhance detract shareholder value. managers believe provisions represent sound reasonable means addressing complex issues corporate policy created current takeover environment whereas vocal shareholders argue direct correspondence college administration management oh phone e mail chamu. sunda vol.  .  copyright elsevier science .  provisions permit lackluster managers stay even shareholders suffer . academics variety disciplines economics finance management also sharply divided views merits antitakeover provisions. scholars argue takeover market serves disciplining mechanism hence managers resist market. scholars argue managerial resistance takeovers enable managers negotiate greater benefits shareholders. empirical work examining impact antitakeover provisions also provided equivocal support either positions. effort devoted reconciling opposing viewpoints regarding antitakeover provisions. omission unfortunate since controversy surrounding managerial action likely continually resurface revival takeover activity. paper therefore attempts fill literature reviewing competing theoretical empirical work antitakeover provisions offering contingency framework reconcile positions. proposed framework recasts debate terms rather whether antitakeover provisions enhance erode shareholder value. drawing broader agency perspective organizational literatures power argued degree shareholder monitoring high antitakeover provisions enhance shareholder value monitoring mechanisms serve alternative takeover market. alternately degree monitoring mechanisms antitakeover provisions erode shareholder value managers protected disciplining effects takeover market. proposed contingency framework therefore embeds debate antitakeover provisions within broader governance context. antitakeover provisions protection erosion shareholder value. theoretical perspectives agency theory motivates debate regarding impact antitakeover provisions. according agency theory managers considered agents stockholders owners corporation. agents resources corporation wealth effects actions. situation managers incentive make choices decisions regarding use resources benefit personally cost giving rise agency problems. reduce agency problems several governance mechanisms exist one market corporate control . managers inappropriately inefficiently managing resources alternative team market corporate control replace managers.  chamu journal management vol.  .  two competing theoretical perspectives premised agency theory motivate addressing relationship adoption antitakeover provisions shareholder interests. one view antitakeover provisions benefit stockholders known stockholder interests hypothesis . competing viewpoint known management entrenchment hypothesis antitakeover provisions stockholders interest. according stockholder interests hypothesis adoption antitakeover provisions would positive impact performance four reasons. first posited adoption antitakeover provisions effectively creates long term contract current management team encourages managers make specific human capital investments. managers unprotected takeover market would incentive invest specific skills skills rewarded labor market. protections antitakeover provisions provide managers incentive invest skills critical long term performance . second managers protected market antitakeover provisions likely invest capital long term projects otherwise used fending takeover threats managing current earnings . proponents shareholder interests hypothesis also emphasize managers without protection market less likely make long term capital investments investments often long pay periods. antitakeover provisions would provide managers incentive invest long term ventures would enhance shareholder value long run. argued antitakeover provisions provide corporate management additional veto power takeover situations shareholders face prisoners dilemma problems situation shareholders better acting collectively incentive act independently collective interests. veto power enable management negotiate better deals stockholders. instance takeover situation involving asymmetric information unique synergy value target bidding greater value target bidder antitakeover provisions provide target management negotiating power able appropriate larger percentage bilateral monopoly gains . another scenario would involve two tier tender offers bidder offers higher shares acquired front end makes lower offer shares tendered end. even though net aggregate value offered shareholders target two tier offer typically lower offered uniform bid structure offer motivates target shareholders quickly tender shares secure higher paid first tier . pressure sell termed distorted choice collective choice

cartelized response hold higher uniform bid. finally case parachute agreements compensate key executives loss job status consequence control authors argue agreements enhance interests stockholders compensation facilitates takeovers. argued parachutes encourage executives objective evaluating alternate takeover bids rather focusing whether skills valued merged company. according managerial entrenchment hypothesis antitakeover provisions result present value loss costs associated antitakeover provisions outweigh benefits potentially higher premium. posited additional veto power provided antitakeover provisions protect managers disciplining influence market result two types negative managerial managers indulging shirking maintaining time . first antitakeover provisions allow managers featherbed shirk responsibilities shareholders without threat displaced. second proponents entrenchment view also indicate protection market forces encourage managerial aversion risk. aversion risk result managers rejecting risky projects reduce term earnings enhance long term value. addition supporters entrenchment argument also argue even though antitakeover provisions completely protect taken reduce probability receiving valuable takeover offers alternative management teams. posited additional managerial veto power provided antitakeover provisions typically increase potential bidder costs mounting takeover attempt thereby reduce incentive potential bidders make offer antitakeover protection. thus antitakeover provisions viewed reducing effectiveness market corporate control reducing

synthesizes arguments proponents critics presents balanced perspective antitakeover provisions topic continues spark controversy light increased takeover activity. contingency could also used examine antitakeover provisions respond takeover bids. researchers could explore high degree shareholder monitoring use antitakeover provisions engage passive auction inducing competitionreducing resistance strategy event takeover bid. auctioninducing opposition would interests target shareholders strategy increases competition control target turn lead increased gains shareholders. antitakeover provisions shareholder value implications journal management vol.  .  regard testing contingency two issues worth emphasizing. first important note shareholder monitoring conceptualized continua number intermediary points two ends. therefore testing contingency researchers define moderators accordingly avoid analytical procedures involve dividing variables distinct categories. second extant works examined parts proposed contingency would useful comprehensive fashion. researchers urged use multivariate designs order able incorporate multiple measures moderators. moderators operate simultaneously relationship antitakeover provisions value. higher order interactions moderators tested interaction monitoring shareholder monitoring respect antitakeover provisions shareholder value. conclusion proposed contingency reframes antitakeover shareholder value debate directs attention relevant issue antitakeover provisions enhance detract shareholder value rather whether antitakeover provisions increase decrease shareholder value. provides richer understanding antitakeover provisions embeds debate within broader governance context. appendix description popular pretender offer antitakeover provisions operating provision requires stockholder approval dual class recapitalization. provision popular mid results dual classes common stocks disparate voting rights. class common stock different number votes per share cases varying claims cash flow. majority created new class limited voting rights shares distributing limited voting rights shares pro rata current shareholders exchanging limited voting rights existing shares voting rights. rarely sold limited voting shares publicly. recapitalization often results management controlling class stock higher voting rights therefore provisions work antitakeover device. new stock exchange exchange maintained one share one vote rule. however nyse relaxed enforcement policy general motors corporation indicated issuing second class stock lower voting rights order finance acquisition. nyse modified standard allow listed companies dual classes equity disparate voting privilege. moratorium delisting dual class initiated several reasons. first exchange concerned possible chamu journal management vol.  .  loss listed securities american stock exchange national association securities dealers relaxed policy regarding unequal voting rights. amex required ratio high vote vote stock exceed ratio vote stock certain rights selecting members nasd restriction. second nyse faced requests listed allowed use dual class recapitalization defending takeovers. finally exchange wanted provide nyse listed flexibility choose capital structure. however securities exchange commission adopted rule c prohibited publicly traded companies issuing stock would effect diluting voting rights current shareholders . supermajority provisions. provision typically stipulates stockholder approval percentages transactions mergers assets specified transactions. requirement often exceeds level shareholder participation meetings therefore taking actions require supermajority approval almost impossible. thus supermajority stockholder approval requirements bidder implementing merger even bidder controls target directors. supermajority amendments also typically include escape clauses applicable actions mergers subsidiary. able determine supermajority provisions effect amendment said clause. pure supermajority provisions seriously limit management flexibility takeover negotiations. classified provisions. provisions segment directors classes one class standing election year. typically classified provision one elected year three year term. classified new majority stockholder would wait two annual meetings attain majority representation vote favor merger proposal. amendments classify often accompanied super majority stockholder approval requirement order number directors thereby inhibiting bidder expanding thus taking control electing candidates newly created positions. thus classified boards reduce probability takeover bid delaying corporate control. fair provisions. provision requires super majority voting approval stockholders transfer control bidder offer fair usually fair defined highest paid bidder shares acquired target specified period premium market . sometimes fair formula elaborate involving outside appraisals. paid merger approved fair investment banking selected directors. many cases one used required fair must least match highest . provision effective antitakeover provisions shareholder value implications journal management vol.  .  mainly hostile two tier tender offers pose collective choice problems shareholders. hostile bidders avoid super majority requirement fair amendment making uniform offer outstanding shares. elimination cumulative voting. provision restricts rights stockholders accumulate votes favor particular director slate directors. typically number votes stockholder entitled number shares owned multiplied number directors elected given year. case cumulative voting shareholder use entitled shares favor one particular candidate making possible minority stockholders elect members even majority stockholders oppose election nominees. elimination cumulative voting rights reduces minority stockholders ability elect nominees directors since one vote used favor desired director nominee . provisions require stockholder approval poison pill. poison pill provisions provide target stockholders right purchase additional shares discount sell shares target attractive prices. target stockholders right purchase discount known flip plan. flip plan declares common stock dividend form rights purchase class securities usually common stock. potent flip plan mere acquisition threshold stake enables rights holders purchase additional shares target discount. intended result one dares pass flip triggering percentage bidders forced negotiate target boards. approximately half flip plans contain flip provision. finally right sell shares target attractive called end plan. end plans attempts place specific minimum end two tier acquisition bid. provisions essentially raise costs imposed potential bidder. chewable poison pills used. provision overrides flip flip provisions event acceptable bid . acceptable bid fully financed cash tender offer least target stock least window shareholders consider offer. parachute. provisions provide generous severance package key executives event firing demotion resignation within specified period time following control. oil proxy statement describes parachutes existing future officers providing lump sum compensation officer event voluntary involuntary termination employment within one year control. control occurs party acquires least company outstanding common stock chamu journal management vol.  .  case subsidiary greater . provisions present approximately companies amount millions dollars pose significant financial burden potential bidder. late ten primerica executives received . million result takeover. therefore parachutes raise costs associated takeover bid.

focus maximal performance.fact ability appears important motivation training performance intriguing. possibility training particularly hire training represents strong situation trainees tend highly motivated learn relevant knowledge skills.turn constrain variance motivation attenuate relations motivation performance.contrast ability motivation appear approximately equally important performance measures tend assess typical performance long periods.discovery somewhat unexpected given strong track record ability predictor performance suggests motivation important performance ability.implications talent management practices present findings also point actionable steps organizations take improve acquire talent.first results reveal ability motivation weakly correlated.fact ability motivation largely variables tend demonstrate relations performance suggests organizations measure variables predict future performance.words talent management systems emphasize ability expense motivation vice versa likely suboptimal influencing predicting future performance.second general lack support multiplicative suggests applicants allowed compensate lower scores ability

combined.ability motivation interact influence performance would suggest interventions designed increase motivation target employees possess high level ability.present results challenge idea suggest interventions focus employees ability levels.fourth findings suggest compared motivation ability important performance training laboratory studies designed simulate performance thus practitioners aware findings training laboratory studies overestimate importance ability underestimate importance motivation performance.fifth found ability better predictor objective performance measures.implication type performance organizations would like influence inform individual differences assess selection process influence training development incentive programs.january instance present findings suggest outcomes sales productivity strategically critical supervisor evaluations employee performance organizations focus ability.hand organization particularly interested improving supervisor evaluations focus motivation.limitations directions future acknowledge several potential limitations first despite extensive search primary studies number samples available analyses small.studies inclusion criteria used traitlike measures motivation fewer studies included ability performance statelike measures motivation.particular surprisingly measured effort directly particularly field settings.given theoretical importance effort work motivation encourage construct.found measures various constructs contain items amount duration effort devoted work tasks including measures conscientiousness engagement work involvement organizational citizenship would helpful future delineate similarities differences among constructs measures bring measurement effort clearer focus.study also points need additional concerning measure effort including measures used high stakes settings issues response distortion concern.second requirement present meta analysis studies include measures ability motivation performance.discussed focusing studies measured three constructs enabled calculate ability motivation interaction estimate effects performance directly compare relative importance ability motivation performance.potential limitation approach meta analysis includes portion studies measured ability performance studies measured motivation performance.result correlations differ might found results based larger primary studies.although mean correlations found ability performance line ability performance correlations several previous meta analyses correlations somewhat different correlations reported meta analyses.mean observed correlation ability performance similar observed correlations reported studies mcclure bertua salgado mulé nathan contrast correlation smaller observed correlation whose values used subsequent meta analyses.several factors contribute somewhat lower ability performance relations observed compared previous meta analyses.studies based solely primarily studies designed validate particular ability meta analysis general aptitude battery.contrast variety ability tests represented present meta analysis ability performance relation primary focus studies cumulated.fact present study performance corrected correlations ability performance slightly larger unpublished studies published studies.ability meta analyses included knowledge work sample tests measures performance whereas include criteria assess performance.relevant ability tends correlate strongly knowledge work sample tests performance ratings productivity records.finally artifact corrections used also different corrections used previous meta analyses.range restriction values ability subsets studies meta analysis appear somewhat larger values used several previous meta analyses.regardless reason believe relations involving ability systematically different relations involving motivation sets estimates taken studies.thus reason believe sometimes smaller ability performance relations observed compared previous meta analyses affect conclusions regarding relative importance ability versus motivation validity additive versus multiplicative models.although made extra efforts understand correct effects range restriction proved challenging endeavor.many studies enough information determine whether range restriction relevant specific restriction.studies likely provide information concerning whether ability scores restricted whereas tended less information possible restriction motivation.thus instances range restriction corrected results underestimate magnitude relations involving motivation.finally even could reasonably confident range restriction mechanism within particular samples often information needed implement appropriate corrections.thus sometimes make assumptions values studies data spite considerations given consistency results across types analyses unlikely implementing additional alternative range restriction corrections would changed substantive conclusions.fourth found several variables appear moderate relative importance ability motivation performance study setting performance measured.however even accounting variables sometimes considerable variance estimates across primary studies moderators statistical artifacts.thus future could examine additional potential moderators.evidence ability relatively important individuals first start whereas motivation relatively important later relatedly reviewed cross sectional examined relations individuals. future might adopt intraindividual approach examine whether relations among ability motivation performance within individuals time.finally present study used meta analysis cumulate interaction effects.hope study serve researchers wish understand magnitude january consistency interactive effects domains.however experience suggests meta analyzing interactions quite challenging.primary studies rarely include exact variables analyses statistics researchers need estimate interactive relations.thus meta analysts must willing devote substantial time effort obtain relevant data statistics primary study authors.urge primary researchers study interactions correlations among variables including product terms results included future meta analyses.conclusions results present study potential conversation regarding theories predict performance well theories disseminated students classrooms decision makers organizations media public discourse.overall findings suggest including ability motivation interactions future theoretical explanations empirical models complexity theories models necessarily increase understanding prediction performance. instead findings suggest cases researchers practitioners focus parsimonious additive effects ability motivation performance.addition hope study serve catalyst future meta analysis better understand interactive relations domains.finally hope findings compensatory contributions ability motivation useful practitioners design talent management systems interventions aimed predicting improving employee performance.notes codes values primary study available first author upon request. primary studies found large sample study conducted military training context although multiplicative results study generally consistent overall results studies magnitude correlations additive effects notably different average studies data study emerged strong influential case many analyses.rather reporting results without study time decided exclude study meta analysis. avoid potentially confounding effects performance dimension performance measure limited analyses subjective measures task contextual performance.found highly similar results using measures reflect strength ability motivation interaction percentage simple slopes. regression analysis include organizational context complexity performance dimension factors relevant laboratory studies.however neither organizational context complexity significant predictor ability motivation interaction limited analysis field studies.addition small number task versus contextual performance studies prevented including factor multivariate analyses.'"
