lefkowitz, 1994). thus, women and minorities faced greater\\nchalls in organizational entry and in moving up the organizational ranks. second,\\ngender and ethnic stereotyping also contributed to the lack of acceptance of women and\\nminorities as authoritative figures. for example, certain attributes such as being diligent,\\nintelligent, and reserved among asians were not seen as ‘managerial’ qualities\\n(giscombe and mattis, 2002). third, the lack of similar ‘others’ in high positions also led\\nto the exclusion of women and minorities in organizational networks (giscombe and\\nmattis, 2002), which often provide knowl about an organization (ibarra, 1995).\\nthus, many women reported receiving less information about their companies and being\\nshut out of better jobs (cianni and rombr, 1995).\\n\\npolicy-makers in canada and the us have responded with employment equity\\n(ee) or affirmative action (aa) legislation to remove the barriers facing women and\\nminorities in the workplace (jain and verma, 1996). however, the reaction towards\\nsuch policies has been negative both from the white male majority and from women\\nand minority groups who are the intended beneficiaries. white males are opposed to\\naa because they perceived such practices as abandoning the principle of merit in\\nfavour of numerical targets (falkenband boland, 1997; gilbert , 1999).\\nwomen hired under aa were perceived to be incompetent and less qualified\\n(heilman, 1997; heilman , 1997). as a result, women and minorities resented\\nsuch stigmatization and disassociated themselves from aa. many reported reduced\\nperceptions of competence by others and receiving lower job evaluations (heilman\\nand alcott, 2001). although recent research has shown that aa practices do not\\ngenerally lead to lower credentials or performance (holzer and neumark, 1999,\\n2000), organizations are implementing diversity hrm practices to deal with the\\nstigmatization associated with aa (konrad and linnehan, 1995; gilbert ,\\n1999).\\n\\ndiversity management\\n\\ndiversity management is considered a more popular alternative to aa for two reasons.\\nfirst diversity management can help organizations capitalize on the benefits of a diverse\\nworkforce. cox and blake (1991) proposed that diversity management reduces turnover\\nand absenteeism, attracts the best workers, increases sales and marketing efforts,\\nenhances creativity and innovation, and improves decision-making. thus, executives are\\nmore likely to devote resources and commitment to diversity efforts (robinson and\\ndechant, 1997). second, diversity management is a voluntary corporate approach to\\ndealing with increasing demographic diversity in the workplace. agocs and burr (1996)\\npointed out that diversity management helps promote awareness of individual difference\\nand empathy for those who are different, and encourages attitude change. diversity\\nmanagement also seeks to create a greater inclusion of all individuals into formal\\ncompany programmes and informal networks (gilbert , 1999). consequently, it is\\n\\n1196 the international journal of human resource management\\n\\n\\n\\nviewed as less controversial than aa and thus is useful in dealing with issues left\\nunaddressed by aa.\\n\\nprevious studies have shown that diversity management is related to applicants’\\nintention to pursue employment. organizations with advertised diversity management\\npractices were perceived to be more attractive employers (williams and bauer, 1994),\\nattracted more black applicants (highhouse , 1999a; avery, 2003), and were more\\nsuccessful at recruiting women and minorities (cox and blake, 1991). the supply of\\nwomen and minorities qualified for management positions continues to increase as they\\ncomplete management and professional education programmes (blum , 1994). this\\nstudy investigates women and minority application attraction to management positions,\\nand the quality of applicants who are attracted to diversity management practices.\\nspecifically, we tackle the issue of stigmatization to determine if diversity management\\nis associated with higher-quality applicants, operationalized in terms of achievement\\nability using grade point averages (gpa) and graduate management admission test\\nscores (gmat).\\n\\nconceptual background and theory\\n\\nrynes and cable (2003) argued that applicants are at least as concerned about picking the\\nright organization as about choosing the right job. previous research has shown that\\norganizational policies and practices, corporate image and corporate social performance\\nwere considered when applicants make job-choice decisions (schwoerer and rosen,\\n1989; gatewood , 1993; turban and greening, 1996; highhouse , 1999b;\\nalbinger and freeman, 2000; turban, 2001). this suggests that perceptions of\\norganizational attractiveness are related to employment practices: an organization that\\nprojects a positive employment message may signal that it is likely to provide desirable\\njob attributes, such as strong opportunities for career growth and development, for\\npotential job applicants (rynes and cable, 2003).\\n\\nperson–organization fit\\n\\nperson–organization (p-o) fit, as an attempt to account for how people make\\nassessments of fit between themselves and the organization, offers an explanation of how\\napplicants make decisions about their job choices. chatman (1989) defined p-o fit as ‘the\\ncongruence between organizational values and individual values (which is what\\nindividuals want in an organization)’. murray (1938), in his conceptual work, proposed\\nthat ‘when given a choice, a person activated by a particular need or set of needs may be\\nexpected to seek out the environments that offer fulfillment of these needs, and avoid\\nenvironments that stifle such fulfillment’.\\n\\ntherefore, the congruence between internal state needs and organizational attributes\\ndrives the organizational-choice process. p-o fit occurs when an organization satisfies an\\nindividual’s needs, desires and preferences (kristoff, 1996). thus the fit between an\\nindividual’s values, beliefs and personal characteristics and those of the organization can\\nshed light on the process in which job applicants find organizations attractive and make\\njob-choice decisions. achieving high levels of p-o fit through recruitment is desirable\\nbecause it is linked to work-related outcomes such as organizational commitment,\\nidentification, and retention (kristoff, 1996; saks and ashforth, 1997; van vianen,\\n2000). cable and judge (1996) found that applicants’ perceived value congruence with\\ntheir chosen organization was related to their p-o fit perceptions, and the perceived p-o\\nfit perceptions predicted actual job choice decisions. for example, individuals with high\\n\\nng and burke: person–organization fit and the war for talent 1197\\n\\n\\n\\nneed for achievement were found to be more attracted to organizations that reward\\nperformance (turban and keon, 1993; trank , 2002).\\n\\nadditionally, an individual’s value systems and characteristics are relatively enduring\\n(chatman, 1989). this may be due to the fact that personal values and beliefs are based on\\ngroup identities, such as gender and ethnicity (cox, 1993). applicants develop perceptions\\nof fit with organizations based on their values and identities, and will self-select themselves\\nout of the recruitment process if they perceived a lack of fit. for example, black job\\napplicants more readily accepted an organization’s commitment to diversity when recruiting\\nads depicted blacks in managerial positions (avery, 2003). the congruence between\\napplicants’ preferences, based on group identities, and the recruiting organization’s reputed\\nemployment policies is thus important in organizational attraction.\\n\\nemployment messages\\n\\na recent survey concluded that minority employees, like everyone else, want fulfilling\\nwork, opportunities for advancement and assurances that their efforts will pay off\\n(fortune, 2000). thus organizations that offer opportunities, encouragement and\\ninclusiveness will attract women and minority job applicants. one way in which\\norganizations can communicate this message prior to organizational entry is through\\nemployment messages.\\n\\nan organization’s orientation towards woman and minorities, as reflected in\\nemployment messages, is more salient among women and minority applicants (thomas\\nand wise, 1999). employment messages in recruitment ads serve as a vehicle for\\nproviding insights into the employment relationships offered by organizations (rafaeli\\nand oliver, 1998). as applicants have incomplete information about organizations, they\\ninterpret information they receive as indicators of the organization’s working\\nenvironment. employment messages are particularly important for women and\\nminorities because, unlike their white male counterparts, they do not enjoy the same\\naccess to informal sources of referrals and job information (kirnan , 1989;\\ngiscombe and mattis, 2002). thus, they rely far more heavily on formal sources of\\ninformation, such as job ads, recruitment brochures and the information contained in\\nemployment offers.\\n\\nconsistent with the p-o fit literature, we propose that women and minorities would\\nfind organizations that offer opportunities and a work environment free from\\ndiscrimination to be attractive employers. we expect women and minorities would\\nlook for cues on management practices when making job choice decisions. to test this\\nproposition, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the characteristics of\\napplicants for management jobs who find employers with diversity management to be\\nattractive, and consider diversity management to be important in their job choice\\ndecisions. based on the foregoing, we hypothesize that:\\n\\nhypothesis 1: minority job applicants (i.e. women and ethnic minorities) are more\\nlikely to rate employers with diversity management practices as more\\nattractive.\\n\\nhypothesis 2: minority job applicants will consider diversity management to be an\\nimportant factor in their job-choice decisions.\\n\\nin addition, high achievers with high abilities are also more likely to seek out\\nenvironments that offer challs and opportunities (trank , 2002). many new\\n\\n1198 the international journal of human resource management\\n\\n\\n\\nworkforce entrants are also highly educated and skilled ( immigrant workers) and\\nhave high career aspirations (kirchmeyer and mclellan, 1991; burleton, 2001). thus we\\nexpect that diversity management will also attract job applicants who are high achievers.\\n\\nhypothesis 3: job applicants who are high achievers are more likely to rate employers\\nwith diversity management practices as more attractive.\\n\\nthis study examined job-choice decisions among women and minorities when presented\\nwith offers from organizations with and without diversity practices. although support for\\norganization attractiveness with diversity management did not reach conventional levels\\nof significance (hypothesis 1), the results clearly indicate that women and minorities\\nconsidered organizational diversity practices to be important when accepting employ-\\nment (hypothesis 2). thus, the findings lend support to the p-o fit hypothesis where an\\norganization’s espoused diversity values are related to women and minorities’ job-choice\\ndecisions. a number of factors can influence applicants’ job-choice decisions, such as\\ncompensation (goddeeris, 1988; bretz , 1994), working conditions (bretz and\\njudge, 1998), and the nature of the work offered (chew and teo, 1993; bretz and judge,\\n1998). however, previous studies ( cable and judge, 1996; judge and cable, 1997)\\nhave shown convincingly that p-o fit with an organization’s espoused values is a\\nsignificant factor in an applicant’s job choices. the advantages of the perceived fit to\\norganizations are obvious. high levels of p-o fit lead to improved organizational\\noutcomes such as commitment, identification and retention (saks and ashforth, 1997).\\nfor example, women and minority managers employed in organizations more accepting\\n\\nng and burke: person–organization fit and the war for talent 1205\\n\\n\\n\\nof minorities, experienced more positive treatment, were more satisfied in their careers,\\ncommitted and integrated (burke, 1991; mckeen and burke, 1991).\\n\\nas hypothesized, high achievers (those with first-class grades and gmat scores over\\n700) rated organizations with diversity practices more attractive as employers\\n(hypothesis 3). high achievers look for job challs, rewards and recognition, and\\nfast-track promotions (trank , 2002), while diversity management promises\\nfulfilling work, encouragement and equal opportunities for everyone. thus, it is logical\\nfor high achievers to accept employment with firms associated with diversity\\nmanagement. from an hrm perspective, organizations that can best attract employees\\nwith high levels of ability and achievements can expect to enhance their firms’\\ncompetitiveness (schmidt and hunter, 1981; hough, 1984).\\n\\nadditionally, new immigrants to canada (less than a year) reported greater attraction\\nto organizations with diversity management. this finding is not surprising as many\\nimmigrants are attracted to canada because of its official policy promoting\\nmulticulturalism and acceptance of diversity. many of these immigrants are highly\\ntrained and educated, and are already high achievers in their native countries. they bring\\nwith them a sense of enthusiasm and a willingness to work hard to fulfil their career\\naspirations. building on this knowl, organizations can gain access to and capitalize\\non a highly motivated and talented pool of workers with diversity management practices.\\n\\nconclusions and limitations\\n\\nthis study makes several contributions to diversity management literature, particularly\\nfor women and minority recruitment. first, this study establishes a link between diversity\\nmanagement practices and the attraction of high achievers. it supports the notion that\\nindividuals with high levels of abilities prefer to work for more progressive\\norganizations. as this study represents an initial attempt to investigate this issue, we\\ncaution that more replication is necessary to establish this finding.\\n\\nsecond, the sample in this study is more representative of the diverse population found\\nin most industrialized countries such as the uk, australia, and new zealand, and thus\\nprovides greater generalizability. for example, the sample of this study consisted of 27\\nper cent asians, 9.5 per cent eastern europeans, 3.6 per cent arabs and so on. most\\nstudies on minority applicant attraction have focused on blacks ( highhouse ,\\n1999a; avery, 2003). it is expected that, by 2020, the population of the us will comprise\\n47 per cent hispanics, 22 per cent blacks, 18 per cent asians and other minority groups\\n(perkins , 2000). thus existing studies on minority attraction may have limited\\nexternal validity in the future.\\n\\nthird, this study investigated women and minority attraction at managerial levels.\\nprior research ( gilbert and stead, 1999) concentrated on entry-level positions as it\\nwas not typical for women and minorities to assume upper-level or managerial positions.\\nhowever, recent trends have indicated women and minority talents are no longer in short\\nsupply, and organizations that wish to enhance their competitiveness should seek to\\nrecruit and hire from this diverse pool of workers.\\n\\ndespite the theoretical and practical contributions to the recruitment and diversity\\nliterature, this study has several limitations. first, the main effects of diversity\\nmanagement on organization attractiveness lacked statistical significance (for hypothesis\\n1) or received mixed results ( nv rated as more attractive than fc for gender and for\\nminority status). as previously suggested, a potential explanation for this finding may be\\nattributed to the tone of the letters.2 specifically, the offer from nv appears to make a\\nfriendlier overture and uses phrases like ‘understand starting a new job can be\\n\\n1206 the international journal of human resource management\\n\\n\\n\\noverwhelming’, ‘help make your transition easier’ and ‘feel part of national venture\\nbank before starting’. thus, it is possible that the tone of the letter moderated the effect\\nof organizational effectiveness. for example, degroot and motowidlo (1999) found\\nvisual and vocal cues ( pitch, pitch variability, amplitude variability) during job\\ninterviews affected interviewer judgements. if visual and vocal cues affect interviewer\\njudgements, then a similar effect should also exist between the tone in employment offers\\nand organizational attractiveness. an examination of the tone in employment offers is\\nwarranted in future studies and may help shed light on the effectiveness of employment\\nmessages.\\n\\nsecond, tha and gmat scores were self-reported by the participants, and could\\npotentially suffer from social desirability. due to the close proximity of the participants\\nto each other when responding to the questionnaires, participants may represent\\nthemselves more favourably. for example, when self-reported mean gmat scores are\\ncompared with those published in mba rankings, the self-reported scores are found to be\\nslightly higher (642 vs. 620) (canadian business, 2001). thus, future studies should\\nincorporate other measures, such as peer and supervisory ratings of applicant\\nachievements.\\n\\nin sum, diversity practices make organizations more attractive to women and\\nminorities, and there is initial evidence to show that they also attract high achievers and\\nnew immigrants as potential employees. this finding has important implications for\\ntraditionally homogeneous organizations that remain challd in attracting women and\\nminorities, particularly for managerial and upper-level positions.\\n\\nnotes\\n\\n1 although affirmative action and diversity management are not the same, affirmative action plans\\n\\nand programs form a dimension of diversity management (wright , 1995).\\n2 in order for participants to make job-choice decisions, it was necessary to use two offers. as with\\n\\nany experimental studies, minimal adjustments were made to the letters to keep them as realistic\\n\\nas possible.\\n'"

black applicants and were more successful at recruiting women and minorities. the supply of women and minorities qualified for management positions continues to increase as they complete management and professional education programmes. this study investigates women and minority application attraction to management positions and the quality of applicants who are attracted to diversity management practices. specifically we tackle the issue of stigmatization to determine if diversity management is associated with higher-quality applicants operationalized in terms of achievement ability using grade point averages and graduate management admission test scores. conceptual background and theory rynes and cable argued that applicants are at least as concerned about picking the right organization as about choosing the right job. previous research has shown that organizational policies and practices corporate image and corporate social performance were considered when applicants

expected to seek out the environments that offer fulfillment of these needs and avoid environments that stifle such fulfillment. therefore the congruence between internal state needs and organizational attributes drives the organizational-choice process. p-o fit occurs when an organization satisfies an individual needs desires and preferences. thus the fit between an individual values beliefs and personal characteristics and those of the organization can shed light on the process in which job applicants find organizations attractive and make job-choice decisions. achieving high levels of p-o fit through recruitment is desirable because it is linked to work-related outcomes such as organizational commitment identification and retention. cable and judge found that applicants perceived value congruence with their chosen organization was related to their p-o fit perceptions and the perceived p-o fit perceptions predicted actual job choice decisions. for example individuals with high ng and burke person organization fit and the war for talent need for achievement were found to be more attracted to organizations that reward performance. additionally an individual value systems and characteristics are relatively enduring. this may be due to the fact that personal values and beliefs are based on group identities such as gender and ethnicity. applicants develop perceptions of fit with organizations based on their values and identities and will self-select themselves out of the recruitment process if they perceived lack of fit. for example black job applicants more readily accepted an organization commitment to diversity when recruiting ads depicted blacks in managerial positions. the congruence between applicants preferences based on group identities and the recruiting organization reputed employment policies is thus important in organizational attraction. employment messages recent survey concluded that minority employees like everyone else want fulfilling work opportunities for advancement and assurances that their efforts will pay off. thus organizations that offer opportunities encouragement and inclusiveness will attract women and minority job applicants. one way in which organizations can communicate this message prior to organizational entry is through employment messages. an organization orientation towards woman and minorities as reflected in employment messages is more salient among women and minority applicants. employment messages in recruitment ads serve as vehicle for providing insights into the employment relationships offered by organizations. as applicants have incomplete information about organizations they interpret information they receive as indicators of the organization working environment. employment messages are particularly important for women and minorities because unlike their white male counterparts they do not enjoy the same access to informal sources of referrals and job information. thus they rely far more heavily on formal sources of information such as job ads recruitment brochures and the information contained in employment offers. consistent with the p-o fit literature we propose that women and minorities would find organizations that offer opportunities and work environment free from discrimination to be attractive employers. we expect women and minorities would look for cues on management practices when making job choice decisions. to test this proposition we conducted an experimental study to investigate the characteristics of applicants for management jobs who find employers with diversity management to be attractive and consider diversity management to be important in their job choice decisions. based on the foregoing we hypothesize that hypothesis minority job applicants are more likely to rate employers with diversity management practices as more attractive. hypothesis minority job applicants will consider diversity management to be an important factor in their job-choice decisions. in addition high achievers with high abilities are also more likely to seek out environments that offer challs and opportunities. many new the international journal of human resource management workforce entrants are also highly educated and skilled and have high career aspirations. thus we expect that diversity management will also attract job applicants who are high achievers. hypothesis job applicants who are high achievers are more likely to rate employers with diversity management practices as more attractive. this study examined job-choice decisions among women and minorities when presented with offers from organizations with and without diversity practices. although support for organization attractiveness with diversity management did not reach conventional levels of significance the results clearly indicate that women and minorities considered organizational diversity practices to be important when accepting employment. thus the findings lend support to the p-o fit hypothesis where an organization espoused diversity values are related to women and minorities job-choice decisions. number of factors can influence applicants job-choice decisions such as compensation working conditions and the nature of the work offered. however previous studies have shown convincingly that p-o fit with an organization espoused values is significant factor in an applicant job choices. the advantages of the perceived fit to organizations are obvious. high levels of p-o fit lead to improved organizational outcomes such as commitment identification and retention. for example women and minority managers employed in organizations more accepting ng and burke person organization fit and the war for talent of minorities experienced more positive treatment were more satisfied in their careers committed and integrated. as hypothesized high achievers rated organizations with diversity practices more attractive as employers. high achievers look for job challs rewards and recognition and fast-track promotions while diversity management promises fulfilling work encouragement and equal opportunities for everyone. thus it is logical for high achievers to accept employment with firms associated with diversity management. from an hrm perspective organizations that can best attract employees with high levels of ability and achievements can expect to enhance their firms competitiveness. additionally new immigrants to canada reported greater attraction to organizations with diversity management. this finding is not surprising as many immigrants are attracted to canada because of its official policy promoting multiculturalism and acceptance of diversity. many of these immigrants are highly trained and educated and are already high achievers in their native countries. they bring with them sense of enthusiasm and willingness to work hard to fulfil their career aspirations. building on this knowl organizations can gain access to and capitalize on highly motivated and talented pool of workers with diversity management practices. conclusions and limitations this study makes several contributions to diversity management literature particularly for women and minority recruitment. first this study establishes link between diversity management practices and the attraction of high achievers. it supports the notion that individuals with high levels of abilities prefer to work for more progressive organizations. as this study represents an initial attempt to investigate this issue we caution that more replication is necessary to establish this finding. second the sample in this study is more representative of the diverse population found in most industrialized countries such as the uk australia and new zealand and thus provides greater generalizability. for example the sample of this study consisted of per cent asians. per cent eastern europeans. per cent arabs and so on. most studies on minority applicant attraction have focused on blacks. it is expected that by the population of the us will comprise per cent hispanics per cent blacks per cent asians and other minority groups. thus existing studies on minority attraction may have limited external validity in the future. third this study investigated women and minority attraction at managerial levels. prior research concentrated on entry-level positions as it was not typical for women and minorities to assume upper-level or managerial positions. however recent trends have indicated women and minority talents are no longer in short supply and organizations that wish to enhance their competitiveness should seek to recruit and hire from this diverse pool of workers. despite the theoretical and practical contributions to the recruitment and diversity literature this study has several limitations. first the main effects of diversity management on organization attractiveness lacked statistical significance or received mixed results. as previously suggested potential explanation for this finding may be attributed to the tone of the letters. specifically the offer from nv appears to make friendlier overture and uses phrases like understand starting new job can be the international journal of human resource management overwhelming help make your transition easier and feel part of national venture bank before starting. thus it is possible that the tone of the letter moderated the effect of organizational effectiveness. for example degroot and motowidlo found visual and vocal cues during job interviews affected interviewer judgements. if visual and vocal cues affect interviewer judgements then similar effect should also exist between the tone in employment offers and organizational attractiveness. an examination of the tone in employment offers is warranted in future studies and may help shed light on the effectiveness of employment messages. second tha and gmat scores were self-reported by the participants and could potentially suffer from social desirability. due to the close proximity of the participants to each other when responding to the questionnaires participants may represent themselves more favourably. for example when self-reported mean gmat scores are compared with those published in mba rankings the self-reported scores are found to be slightly higher. thus future studies should incorporate other measures such as peer and supervisory ratings of applicant achievements. in sum diversity practices make organizations more attractive to women and minorities and there is initial evidence to show that they also attract high achievers and new immigrants as potential employees. this finding has important implications for traditionally homogeneous organizations that remain challd in attracting women and minorities particularly for managerial and upper-level positions. notes although affirmative action and diversity management are not the same affirmative action plans and programs form dimension of diversity management.  in order for participants to make job-choice decisions it was necessary to use two offers. as with any experimental studies minimal adjustments were made to the letters to keep them as realistic as possible. \n",
