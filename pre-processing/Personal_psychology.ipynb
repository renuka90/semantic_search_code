destatis, 2009). in many organizations, different\\nindividuals from three or even four generations will work together. as a\\nconsequence, ways to achieve the joint gement of these diverse age\\ngroups will be a key factor in the future success of companies.\\n\\none important factor in reaching the high productivity of all agoups\\nmay be an organization-wide age-diversity climate, best described as em-\\nployees’ shared perceptions of an organization’s diversity-related policies,\\npractices, and procedures (gelfand, nishii, raver, & schneider, 2005;\\nkossek & zonia, 1993; pugh, dietz, brief, & wiley, 2008) in terms of\\nage. although research on general diversity climate is apparently em\\ning from its “embryonic stage” (van knippenb& schippers, 2007,\\np. 532), more distinct forms of diversity-related climate perceptions have\\nstill not attracted the attention they deserve. in particular, the concept of\\nage-diversity climate has—to our knowl—not yet been studied in\\nany theoretical or empirical context. given the practical importance of\\nthe demographic change and the rising age diversity in most developed\\ncountries, this is a serious shortcoming of the literature. as schneider,\\nehrhart, and macey (2011) argue, scholars should strive for a best possi-\\nble match between the climate they study and the antecedents and effects\\nthey predict in order to gain a high predictive validity of their model.\\nin other words, if one is interested in the role of age in the workplace,\\nit might be more revealing to develop and test a nomological net of\\nage-diversity climate than of general diversity climate. therefore, this\\nstudy aims to establish such a new climate measure while equally in-\\nvestigating potential antecedents and consequences at the organizational\\nlevel.\\n\\nfirst, we draw from work on general diversity climate (,\\ngonzalez & denisi, 2009; kossek & zonia, 1993; mckay, avery, liao,\\n& morris, 2011; mor barak, cherin, & berkman, 1998) as well as that\\non older employees (, armstrong-stassen & lee, 2009; kooij, jansen,\\ndikkers, & de lange, 2010) to develop a sound definition and empirical\\nvalidation of the age-diversity climate construct at the organizational level\\nof analysis.\\n\\nsecond, we follow recent calls to “conduct studies to uncover the\\nhr practices associated with pro-diversity climates” (avery & mckay,\\n2010, p. 242). more specifically, we will define and validate a measure\\nof age-inclusive human resource practices as a potential antecedent of an\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  669\\n\\norganizational age-diversity climate. building upon the work of kopel-\\nman, brief, and guzzo (1990) and applying arguments from theories of\\nsignaling and collective sensemaking (casper & harris, 2008; den har-\\ntog, boselie, & paauwe, 2004; ostroff & bowen, 2000), we assume that\\nhuman resource (hr) practices, which are adjusted to an age-diverse\\nworkforce (, armstrong-stassen & lee, 2009; armstrong-stassen &\\nschlosser, 2011; armstrong-stassen & templer, 2006), are positively re-\\nlated to age-diversity climate.\\n\\nthird, we strive to establish age-diversity climate as a performance an-\\ntecedent on the organizational level of analysis. although different types\\nof climate have been reported to be relevant for individual-, group-, or\\nunit-level outcomes (, gelade & ivery, 2003; gonzalez & denisi,\\n2009; mckay , 2011), no study to our knowl has investi-\\ngated the organizational-level consequences of diversity climate (mckay,\\navery, & morris, 2009). given the ongoing discussion on the “business\\ncase for diversity” (robinson & dechant, 1997, p. 21), this seems to be\\none of the major gaps in diversity climate research, calling for a detailed\\nempirical inspection of across-firm differences with regard to diversity-\\nrelated performance effects (avery & mckay, 2010). thus, building upon\\ncox’s (1994) interactional model of cultural diversity (imcd), we will\\nemploy social exchange theory to argue for a positive relation of a pro-\\nnounced age-diversity climate with firm-wide perceptions of social ex-\\nchange, which in turn relate positively to the performance of an organiza-\\ntion as well as negatively to employees’ collective turnover intentions.\\n\\nfinally, by establishing a model that assumes an indirect relationship\\nof age-inclusive hr practices via age-diversity climate on company\\noutcomes, we also strive to contribute to the hrm literature. in the past\\ndecade, hrm research has made significant progress in opening the\\n“black box” between certain bundles of hr measures and firm perfor-\\nmance (see combs, liu, hall, & ketchen, 2006; lepak, liao, chung, &\\nharden, 2006 for theoretical and empirical reviews). more specifically,\\nrecent research has shed light on the role of climates as intermediating\\nvariables between hr practices and company outcomes (, chuang &\\nliao, 2010; collins & smith, 2006; takeuchi, lepak, wang, & takeuchi,\\n2007). our study builds upon this work and extends it by (a) introducing\\nand validating age-inclusive hr practices as a novel hr system for\\nachieving a distinct strategic goal (i.e., fostering a positive age-diversity\\nclimate) and (b) by exploring how age-diversity climate as a new mediator\\ntranslates its potential effects on firm-level outcomes such as productivity\\nor collective turnover intentions. by doing so, we also follow a recent\\ncall by lepak  (2006) to investigate if hr systems for specific\\norganizational objectives exist, such as fostering diversity perceptions\\nwithin firms.\\n\\n\\n\\n670 personnel psychology\\n\\nin sum, our paper aims to further integrate research on both diversity\\nclimate and the hrm–performance link through testing two three-path\\nmediation relationships in a sample of 93 companies with 14,260 employ-\\nees. by doing so, we hope to contribute toward a better understanding\\nof how inclusive hr practices—especially those targeted toward age di-\\nverse employees—may have an impact on firm performance and employee\\nturnover through the creation of a positive age-diversity climate and col-\\nlective perceptions of social exchange.\\n\\ntheory\\n\\nthe hrm–organizational climate–firm performance link\\n\\nin the past decade, theoretical and empirical research has proposed\\nand demonstrated a positive association between well-developed hr prac-\\ntices and organizational performance (arthur, 1994; becker & huselid,\\n1998; huselid, 1995; zacharatos, barling, & iverson, 2005). most schol-\\nars agree, however, that instead of affecting organizational performance\\ndirectly, hr practices may rather lead to certain intermediate processes\\nincluding desirable employee states and behaviors (, chuang & liao,\\n2010; ferris , 1998; gardner, wright, & moynihan, 2011).\\n\\nkopelman  (1990) were among the first to focus on the mediating\\nrole of climate in the hrm–performance link. this line of thought was\\nadopted by scholars such as ostroff and bowen (2000; bowen & ostroff,\\n2004), who developed a theoretical model proposing a positive effect of\\nhrm practices on firm performance via the creation of strong climates.\\nthey explain that in order to be effective, organizations should strive for\\na high alignment between the hr practices they design and thals they\\nwant to achieve (such as fostering a distinct climate).\\n\\nin the meantime, scholars started to empirically test and support such\\nhrm–climate performance relationships (, chuang & liao, 2010;\\ncollins & smith, 2006; takeuchi , 2007). our study builds upon this\\nwork and translates it to the particular context of age-diversity climate,\\nwhich we propose as an important mediator in the age-inclusive hr\\npractices–firm performance relationship.\\n\\n“age-diversity climate” defined\\n\\nwork on diversity climate can be traced back to the original defini-\\ntion of reichers and schneider (1990, p. 22), who defined “organizational\\nclimate” as “shared perceptions of the way things are around here.” the\\nauthors describe organizational climate perceptions as evolving as part of\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  671\\n\\na sensemaking process in which salient workplace stimuli (, certain\\nworkplace conditions, organizational events, and management behavior)\\nare retrieved and interpreted by the workforce. if shared among organiza-\\ntional members, joint perceptions of a distinct climate may evolve (reich-\\ners & schneider, 1990; schneider & reichers, 1983). most scholars agree\\nwith schneider and reichers (1983) that climate is most meaningful if it\\nis specified in terms of having a distinct referent, for example, a climate\\nfor safety (zohar, 2000) or for cooperation (collins & smith, 2006).\\n\\nmost relevant for our study on age-diversity climate is the concept\\nof general diversity climate, which was introduced by scholars such as\\nkossek and zonia (1993) and mor barak  (1998). gelfand \\n(2005, p. 104) defined it as “employees’ shared perceptions of the poli-\\ncies, practices, and procedures that implicitly and explicitly communicate\\nthe extent to which fostering and maintaining diversity and eliminating\\ndiscrimination is a priority in the organization.”\\n\\nbased on this definition, we understand age-diversity climate as a\\nspecific form of a morneral diversity climate and define it as organi-\\nzational members’ shared perceptions of the fair and nondiscriminatory\\ntreatment of employees of all agoups with regard to all relevant organi-\\nzational practices, policies, procedures, and rewards. in practice, it covers\\nmembers’ joint impression that their organization favors an age-diverse\\nworkforce and takes active steps to recruit, promote, and retain employees\\nof all agoups. moreover, it reflects a shared conviction that age is no\\npotential stumbling block in making progress within the organization. in\\nour opinion, it is important to stress that such a pronounced age-diversity\\nclimate reflects an age-neutral organizational behavior toward all groups;\\nthat is, not only should older employees feel free from age-related discrim-\\nination but so should younger workers (, perceiving no disadvantages\\nfrom seniority rules).\\n\\nage-inclusive hr practices\\n\\nin line with prior research, we argue that in order to achieve a distinct\\nclimate (, a positive age-diversity climate), organizations must install\\nsuitable and focused hr practices (bowen & ostroff, 2004). therefore,\\nwe draw from work on hr practices for an aging workforce that have\\nbeen discussed in both research and practice over the past two decades\\n(, armstrong-stassen & lee, 2009; armstrong-stassen & templer,\\n2006; patrickson & hartmann, 1995; saba, guérin, & wils, 1998). most\\nscholars dealing with this topic have proposed to introduce no single,\\nisolated practices but certain bundles of age-related hr practices that are\\ninterrelated, internally consistent and based on a certain organizational\\n\\n\\n\\n672 personnel psychology\\n\\nlogic (kooij , 2010; see also lepak , 2006; macduffie, 1995).\\nhowever, the majority of the existing studies on age related hr practices\\nwere rather practice oriented and did typically not include a scale vali-\\ndation. in addition, almost all existing studies focused on hr practices\\ndesigned only for older workers such as “targeting older employees to\\nupdate current job skills” (armstrong-stassen & templer, 2006, p. 251).\\nas we are interested in hr practices that might nurture a positive age-\\ndiversity climate (and not a positive climate only for older employees),\\nwe felt the need to develop and validate a new scale that reflects this claim\\nof age inclusion. in order to do so, we still drew from existing work on\\nhr practices for older employees and adapted it to the needs of fostering\\nan age diverse workforce.\\n\\nsecond, we drew from avery and mckay’s (2010) listing of prac-\\ntices likely to be associated with pro-diversity work climates (“valid se-\\nlection systems, extensive trainings programs, employee participation,\\ncooperation, formal performance appraisal systems, and merit-based pro-\\nmotions,” p. 242) as a further basis for our item development.\\n\\nthird, we combined these lines of research with the literature on strate-\\ngic human resource systems (see , lepak , 2006) that typically\\nargues that hr systems may impact organizational outcomes directly and\\nindirectly by influencing (a) employees’ skills and knowl bases, (b)\\nemployees’ motivation and effort, as well as (c) employees’ opportunities\\nto contribute to organizational goals (batt, 2002; delery & shaw, 2001;\\nlepak , 2006; macduffie, 1995).\\n\\nbased on this conceptualization, we propose that in order to have a\\nmaximum effect, bundles of age-inclusive hr practices should relate to\\nall three hr policy domains. consequently, they should equally foster\\n(a) all employees’ (irrespective of their age) knowl, skills, and abili-\\nties; (b) motivation and effort; and (c) opportunities to contribute (lepak\\n, 2006). with regard to hr policy domain 1 (knowl, skills, and\\nabilities), age-inclusive hr practices might include age-neutral recruiting\\nactivities as well as equal access to training and further education for all\\nagoups. in this way, organizations can make sure that all agoups\\nhave the necessary knowl and skills to perform their jobs successfully\\nand ultimately contribute to firm performance.\\n\\nwith regard to hr policy domain 2 (motivation and effort), age-\\ninclusive hr practices might include equal opportunities to be promoted,\\ntransferred, and to make further career steps irrespective of one’s age. in\\naddition, training and educating managers on how to deal with an age-\\ndiverse workforce and how to respond to the needs of different agoups\\nmight also be an important lever of employee motivation. by ging in\\nsuch practices, firms can ensure that all agoups do not only have the\\nskills but also the necessary motivation to contribute to joint goals.\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  673\\n\\nfinally, with regard to hr policy domain 3 (opportunities to con-\\ntribute), age-inclusive hr practices might include the promotion of an\\nage-friendly organizational culture that promotes and values the contribu-\\ntion of all agoups. such an age-inclusive culture should help to provide\\nall employees with the courage to speak up, to bring in their own ideas,\\nand to help improve organizational creativity and effectiveness. in sum,\\norganizations interested in effectively managing an age-diverse workforce\\nshould make sure that their age-inclusive hr practices ideally cover all\\nthree hr policy domains and take into account the needs of both younger\\nand older employees, and not exclusively those of certain agoups.\\n\\nrelationship of age-inclusive hr practices with age-diversity climate\\n\\nbuilding upon theories of signaling and collective sensemaking\\n(casper & harris, 2008; ostroff & bowen, 2000), we hypothesize that\\norganizational members perceive such age-inclusive hr measures that\\nare targeted toward the development of an age-diverse and age-embracing\\nworkforce. den hartog  (2004) explain how hr policies can function\\nas a signal of the organization’s intention toward its workers. similarly,\\nbowen and ostroff (2004) describe how hrm systems may explicate to\\nemployees what is collectively desired and expected from them. if em-\\nployees experience that newly hired colles in their department are\\ncoming from all agoups and that employees have equal opportunities\\nto be promoted and to get training, then they may perceive these as clear\\nsignals that the organization is interested in attracting and retaining an\\nage-diverse workforce. in addition, hr practices that educate executives\\nabout the need for an inclusive leadership behavior as well as an appreci-\\nation of the particular contribution of all agoups’ may be interpreted\\nas clear signals of an age-friendly climate.\\n\\norganizational members are believed to interpret these signals and to\\ncollectively make sense (schneider, 1990, 2000) of such age-inclusive\\nbehavioral guidelines. as the management (, hr) is taking a credible\\ninterest in the proactive gement of employees of all agoups, it can\\nbe expected that the organizational members themselves understand that\\nthe fostering of age diversity as well as the prevention of any age-related\\ndiscrimination are major corporatals. this should have a positive\\nimpact on both their own behavior toward members of different agoups\\nand on the shared age-diversity climate within the organization. on the\\nbasis of these arguments, we suggest the following:\\n\\nhypothesis 1: age-inclusive hr practices will be positively related to\\nrespondents’ perceptions of age-diversity climate.\\n\\n\\n\\n674 personnel psychology\\n\\nrelationship of age-diversity climate with company performance and\\ncollective turnover intentions via collective perceptions of social exchange\\n\\nin order to argue for a potentially positive effect of age-diversity cli-\\nmate on company performance and collective turnover intentions, we\\ngenerally draw from kopelman ’s (1990) climate model of firm pro-\\nductivity. this model proposes that climate impacts firm performance\\nthrough its positive effects on desirable cognitive and affective states\\n(, work motivation) as well as relevant organizational behaviors (,\\ncommitment or citizenship). similarly, cox’s (1994) imcd argues that\\na positive diversity climate should first affect individual affective and\\nperformance outcomes (such as job satisfaction or job performance rat-\\nings), which in turn should have a positive impact on first-level (,\\nturnover) and second-level organizational outcomes (, profitability).\\nin the meantime, there is also considerable empirical support for such\\npositive relationships of diversity climate with collective performance\\n(mckay , 2009) or customer satisfaction (mckay , 2011) as\\nwell as for a negative relationship with turnover intentions (mckay ,\\n2007). in our study, we build upon this line of research and further specify\\nit by introducing social exchange relationships of the employees with their\\ncompanies as an often assumed, however seldom tested, mediator of the\\ndiversity climate–firm outcomes link.\\n\\nrelationship of age-diversity climate with collective perceptions of social\\nexchange. if a pronounced age-diversity climate exists within a firm,\\nemployees are more likely to perceive a fair treatment by their organi-\\nzation. they will experience that no preferential treatment is given to\\nany employee based on his or her age and that all agoups receive\\nequal levels of support by the organization, expressed in equal access to\\ntraining, comparable development and promotion opportunities, and so\\non. this sense of being taken care of regardless of their age should fos-\\nter all employees’ (a) feelings of justice, (b) trust in their employer, (c)\\nbelief that the organization significantly invests in them, (d) long-term\\norientation toward their employment relationship, and (e) conviction that\\nthey receive socioemotional support and not only a financial compensa-\\ntion. all these potential implications of a distinct age-diversity climate in\\nthe workplace are important antecedents or even characteristics of social\\nexchange relationships (blau, 1964; shore, tetrick, lynch, & barksdale,\\n2006).\\n\\nas described by blau (1964), social exchanges involve mutual obli-\\ngations such that, when one party is doing a favor to another, there is\\nan expectancy of some future return. as the exact form and point in\\ntime of the future return are often diffuse, trust and a long-term orienta-\\ntion are key to social exchange relationships (konovsky & pugh, 1994;\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  675\\n\\nshore , 2006). perceived justice also has been found to be an impor-\\ntant predictor of high-quality social exchange relationships (masterson,\\nlewis, goldman, & taylor, 2000; moorman, blakely, & niehoff, 1998;\\nwayne, shore, bommer, & tetrick, 2002), which involve mutual invest-\\nments between both partners as well as a concern for the interest of\\nthe other party in the respective relationship (blau, 1964; shore ,\\n2011).\\n\\nin sum, organizations characterized by a pronounced age-diversity\\nclimate are more likely to be perceived as just, trustworthy, investing in\\nits employees, and long-term orientated, which should foster employees’\\ncollective perception of a strong social exchange relationship between\\nthemselves and their employer. this assumption is in line with theoretical\\nwork of shore  (2011), who proposed that inclusive climates should\\ntrigger perceptions of fairness and trust, which are important for devel-\\noping social exchange relationships. moreover, from an empirical point\\nof view, shore  (2011) showed that employees who perceive their\\norganization to be committed toward them (i.e., perceiving high organiza-\\ntional support) reported higher levels of social exchange with their firm.\\ntakeuchi  (2007) found evidence for such a relationship also on the\\ncollective level of analysis, indicating that employees can develop shared\\nsocial exchange perceptions within their establishments or organizations.\\n\\nbased on these arguments, we hypothesize:\\n\\nhypothesis 2: age-diversity climate will be positively related to collec-\\ntive perceptions of social exchange.\\n\\nrelationship of collective perceptions of social exchange with company\\nperformance and collective turnover intentions. taking this process one\\nstep further, employees should not stop by just perceiving a htened\\nlevel of social exchange in the workplace.\\n\\ncompared to more short-term and impersonal economic exchanges,\\nsocial exchanges are based on a norm of reciprocity (gouldner, 1960),\\nwhich implies that “(1) people should help those who have helped them,\\nand (2) people should not injure those who have helped them” (p. 171).\\ntransferred to an organizational context, employees perceiving high so-\\ncial exchange should reciprocate their organizations’ efforts through own\\nintensified work-related endeavors with positive effects for their work per-\\nformance, their organizational commitment, and their attachment (aryee,\\nbudhwar, & chen, 2002; cropanzano & mitchell, 2005; eisenbr,\\nhuntington, hutchison, & sowa, 1986; shore & wayne, 1993). sup-\\nporting this assumption, tsui, pearce, porter, and tripoli (1997) showed\\nthat employees who perceive their relationship with their organization\\nas characterized by mutual investments performed better on core tasks,\\n\\n\\n\\n676 personnel psychology\\n\\nexhibited more pronounced organizational citizenship behaviors and re-\\nported a higher intent to stay.\\n\\nin addition, positive perceptions of high social exchange should not\\nonly increase employees’ willingness to contribute to organizational goals\\nbut should also positively affect their willingness to support colles.\\ntakeuchi  (2007, p. 1071) explain how high degrees of social ex-\\nchange should spur social support among coworkers, leading to “positive\\nsynes” between group members and ultimately to increased organiza-\\ntional performance (see also podsakoff, ahearne, & mackenzie, 1997).\\nin sum, a balanced, fair, and reciprocal relationship between employees\\nand the organization (expressed through high levels of collective percep-\\ntions of social exchange) seems likely to trigger behaviors above and\\nbeyond the call of duty, with positive effects for coworkers, customers,\\nand other relevant organizational stakeholders that ultimately impact firm\\nperformance and collective turnover intentions.\\n\\nthere is also empirical work that has shown that social exchange\\nperceptions and performance/reduced turnover are related on both the in-\\ndividual (tsui , 1997) and collective level of analysis (takeuchi ,\\n2007). as a most important finding for our study, takeuchi  (2007)\\ndemonstrated a positive relation between the degree of social exchange\\ncollectively perceived in an establishment and establishment performance.\\nbased on the theoretical and empirical arguments presented above, we\\npropose the following:\\n\\nhypothesis 3: collective perceptions of social exchange will be posi-\\ntively related to company performance.\\n\\nhypothesis 4: collective perceptions of social exchange will be nega-\\ntively related to collective turnover intentions.\\n\\nmediation hypotheses\\n\\nhypothesis 1 predicts a positive influence of age-inclusive hr prac-\\ntices on age-diversity climate. hypothesis 2 predicts a positive relation-\\nship between age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social\\nexchange. hypotheses 3 and 4 predict a positive relationship between\\ncollective perceptions of social exchange and company performance, and\\na negative one with collective turnover intentions, respectively. together,\\nthese hypotheses specify a model in which age-inclusive hr measures\\nindirectly influence company performance and collective turnover inten-\\ntions by contributing to organizational members’ joint perception of a\\npronounced age-diversity climate and social exchange level. this view\\nis consistent with recent hrm research that has consistently made use\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  677\\n\\nof climates as mediators between bundles of hr practices and firm per-\\nformance (, chuang & liao, 2010; collins & smith, 2006; lepak\\n, 2006; ostroff & bowen, 2000; takeuchi , 2007). by introduc-\\ning age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange\\nas potential mediators, we build upon this work and hope to shed more\\nlight on the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and organi-\\nzational outcomes, which has received an insufficient amount of attention\\nto date. consequently, we propose the following three-path mediation\\nhypotheses:\\n\\nhypothesis 5: the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and\\ncompany performance is mediated through a firm’s age-\\ndiversity climate and collective perceptions of social ex-\\nchange.\\n\\nhypothesis 6: the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and\\ncollective turnover intentions is mediated through a firm’s\\nage-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social\\nexchange.\\n\\nthis study investigated the emnce and effects of age-diversity\\nclimate at the organizational level of analysis. more specifically, we de-\\nveloped an integrated model attempting to specify how age-inclusive hr\\npractices may impact employees’ shared age-diversity climate percep-\\ntions, which in turn should be directly related to collective perceptions\\nof social exchange and indirectly to both firm performance and collective\\nturnover intentions.\\n\\nbuilding upon existing work on diversity climate, we first developed\\na theoretical understanding and empirical measurement of a firm’s age-\\ndiversity climate. next, we developed a measure of age-inclusive hr\\npractices and drew from work of kopelman  (1990) to explain how\\nsuch organization-wide hr practices might positively influence members’\\nage-diversity climate perceptions through processes of signaling and col-\\nlective sensemaking (hypothesis 1). thirdly, building upon cox’s (1994)\\nimcd and social exchange theory, we linked age-diversity climate to\\ncollective perceptions of social exchange (hypothesis 2), which in turn\\n\\n6in this alternative model all proposed relationships remained significant on a 5% level.\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  691\\n\\nshould predict firm performance (hypothesis 3) and collective turnover\\nintentions (hypothesis 4). finally, we argued for and tested two full me-\\ndiation models of age-inclusive hr practices leading to firm performance\\n(hypothesis 5) and collective turnover intentions (hypothesis 6) through\\ntheir effects on age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social\\nexchange. in sum, we found support for all of our hypotheses.\\n\\nwe believe that these results contribute to the literature by substanti-\\nating and extending prior findings in at least four ways. first, with regard\\nto the diversity climate literature, one important contribution of our study\\ncan be identified in terms of describing, validating, and empirically test-\\ning age-diversity climate as a special form of the morneral diversity\\nclimate construct. this seems significant for at least two reasons. on\\nthe one hand, there is a clear research trend to describe more specified\\nforms of climate (, safety, justice, or cooperation climate) instead\\nof general work climates as these allow for more detailed insights into\\nclimate-related forms of organizational behavior (schneider , 2011).\\non the other hand, given the ongoing demographic change in most indus-\\ntrialized economies (destatis, 2009; tempest , 2002; u.s. bureau of\\nlabor statistics, 2008), age diversity can be expected to become one of\\nthe most relevant diversity categories in the very near future. moreover,\\nas recent research shows, increasing levels of age diversity are far from\\nhaving just a positive influence on employees’ well-being and on firm\\nperformance ( kearney & gebert, 2009; kunze , 2011, 2013;\\nzr & lawrence, 1989). consequently, both scholarly research on and\\nthe practical promotion and nurturing of a distinct age-diversity climate\\nseem highly promising.\\n\\nour second contribution to the climate and hr literature concerns the\\nanalysis of age-inclusive hr practices as a distinct driver of htened\\nlevels of age-diversity climate. although scholars like pugh  (2008)\\nand avery and mckay (2010) mention that hr practices were repeatedly\\nproposed as potential sources of diversity climates, actual studies on this\\nrelation are scarce. most empirical research deals instead with individual\\nemployees’ demographic characteristics, such as their gender or ethnicity\\n(, hicks-clarke & iles, 2000; kossek & zonia, 1993), or the demo-\\ngraphic composition of the entire workforce (, kossek, markel, &\\nmchugh, 2003; mckay & avery, 2006; pugh , 2008) as drivers for\\norganizational members’ diversity climate perceptions. our study differs\\nsignificantly from this approach as it investigates the influence of actual\\nhr practices on age-diversity climate. for practitioners, this might pro-\\nvide the advantage of having a toolkit on hand to help effectively manage\\nan age-diverse workforce, as a supplement to focusing on recruiting is-\\nsues (with which they can change only the demographic composition of\\ntheir firm). in this regard, our study also contributes to the literature on\\n\\n\\n\\n692 personnel psychology\\n\\nage-related hr practices, which has mostly been descriptive to date and\\nhas focused more on the configuration and dissemination than on the\\nperformance consequences of such measures. in addition, existing scales\\nseem to have been exclusively focused on the productive gement of\\nolder employees. although this is an important premise for the long-term\\ngement of an aging workforce, it might not be enough for the sus-\\ntainable success of an age-diverse workforce. therefore, we theoretically\\ndeveloped, empirically validated, and practically tested a new measure\\nfor an age-inclusive hr system. by providing empirical support for the\\nhypothesis that age-inclusive hr bundles are relevant for performance\\nand employee retention, this paper offers companies an even stronger mo-\\ntivation to actually install and foster such practices that enable an effective\\ncollaboration of both younger and older employees in the workplace. by\\ndoing so, we also followed a call by lepak  (2006) and demonstrated\\nthat specific hr systems might indeed relate to specific organizational\\nobjectives, such as fostering positive diversity perceptions within firms.\\n\\nour third contribution to the climate literature relates to our two out-\\ncome variables: firm performance and collective turnover intentions. as\\ndescribed by mckay  (2009; avery and mckay, 2010), there is a\\ndearth of quantitative studies that investigate the organizational-level per-\\nformance outcomes of diversity climate. most of the existing studies have\\neither established the consequences of diversity climate on thoup or\\nunit level. with our dataset that combines data from the corporate level of\\nanalysis (with regard to age-inclusive hr practices and performance of 93\\nindependent companies) with aggregated data collected at the individual\\nlevel of analysis (with regard to age-diversity climate and collective social\\nexchange perceptions of 14,260 employees nested in these firms), we were\\nable to test and affirm the positive relation between (age-)diverse work\\nclimates and firm performance as well as the negative relation to collective\\nturnover intentions across companies, thereby supporting a “business case\\nfor diversity” (robinson & dechant, 1997).\\n\\nour fourth and final contribution pertains to the linkage of the climate\\nand the hr literature. our study corroborated prior findings implying a\\nmediating role of organizational climates in the hr practices–firm perfor-\\nmance link (, bowen & ostroff, 2004; chuang & liao, 2010; takeuchi\\n, 2007). we built upon and extended these findings by introducing\\nage-diversity climate as a relevant mediator and thereby also better con-\\nnected the strategic hr and the diversity literature. indeed, supported by\\nbootstrapping analyses, we even found a full mediation of age-diversity\\nclimate and collective perceptions of social exchange in the age-inclusive\\nhr practices-firm performance relationship. we are, however, aware of\\nthe fact that there might be additional potential mediators of this relation-\\nship. as age-inclusive hr practices are developed to improve employees’\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  693\\n\\nskills, their motivation, and their opportunities to contribute, there might be\\nfurther mediating processes that explain the underlying hr-performance\\nrelationship. for instance, investing in training and knowl acquisition\\nfor employees of all agoups might help the employees to develop a\\nbetter product innovation or customer service competency. nevertheless,\\nwe believe that (age-)diversity climate is an especially powerful mediator\\nas it reflects a workforce’s potential to work together effectively and to\\ninclude people irrespective of their demographic background—probably\\none of the most important triggers of long-term firm success.\\n\\npractical implications\\n\\nmost corporate leaders in industrialized countries seem to have real-\\nized that the demographic change with aging populations, low birth rates,\\nand large cohorts of future retirees will have tremendous implications for\\ntheir firms. hr managers, in particular, are increasingly aware of the fact\\nthat they bear an immense responsibility to manage the challs of the\\nongoing demographic shift (, lack of young professionals, aging of pro-\\nduction staff, increasing age-diversity of the workforce) in order to secure\\nthe long-term productivity of their companies (dychtwald , 2004;\\nelliott, 1995; kunisch, boehm, & boppel, 2011). our study’s results may\\nsupport them in these endeavors.\\n\\nfirst, practitioners should be aware of the fact that age-inclusive hr\\npractices are a promising tool in managing an aging workforce. as our\\nstudy has shown, potential elements of such age-inclusive hr bundles are\\nage-neutral recruiting policies, equal access to training for all agoups,\\nage-neutral career and promotion systems, initiatives to educate managers\\nabout leading age-diversity in the workplace, as well as the promotion\\nof an age-inclusive corporate culture. although these measures should\\nnot be regarded as an exhaustive list, they provide practitioners with a\\ngood starting point in order to effectively manage employees from all age\\ngroups. moreover, as our analyses indicate, the introduction of such age-\\ninclusive hr systems seems to be beneficial for all organizations and not\\njust for those characterized by a high average age or a high age diversity\\nof their workforce.\\n\\nsecond, hr managers as well as leadership personnel throughout the\\nfirm should be conscious of the crucial role of a positive age-diversity\\nclimate in translating (age-inclusive) hr measures into performance and\\nemployee retention. consequently, the fostering of high levels of a pro-\\nage-diverse climate seems very valuable. in addition to investing in hr\\npractices that affect the age-diversity climate, companies could also think\\nabout influencing it in additional ways. in this regard, pugh  (2008,\\n\\n\\n\\n694 personnel psychology\\n\\np. 1427) have suggested “actively help[ing] their employees interpret\\nwhat they see by pointing to the policies, practices, and procedures that\\ncontributed to creating and sustaining a diverse workforce.” in other\\nwords, firms should not only install age-inclusive hr practices but also\\nactively speak about them, increase their employees’ awareness of them,\\nand ultimately make these practices a key component of their so-called\\ncorporate dna. by doing so, they should be able to promote even higher\\nlevels of age-diversity climate, which in turn should positively and sus-\\ntainably impact their bottom line.\\n\\nlimitations and future research directions\\n\\nalthough this study profits from numerous methodological strhs\\n(, independent data sources for most study variables and a large\\norganizational-level dataset), there are several limitations that should be\\nnoted when interpreting the study’s findings.\\n\\nfirst, this was a cross-sectional design study in nature, which pre-\\nvents us from drawing final conclusions about causality. although we\\nhope to have provided convincing theoretical arguments for the described\\ndirections of influence, future studies should aim to overcome this limi-\\ntation by applying a longitudinal research design. this seems especially\\nrelevant for study hypothesis 1, which investigated the impact of age-\\ninclusive hr practices on age-diversity climate. it might be particularly\\nfruitful to study the introduction of age-inclusive hr practices at one\\npoint in time and to measure the development (and potential change) in\\nmembers’ age-diversity perceptions at later points in time. in addition,\\nquasi-experimental research designs (shadish, cook, & campbell, 2002)\\nin which participating organizations are randomly or post-hoc assigned\\nto treatments (i.e., the introduction of age-inclusive hr practices) might\\nallow a causal linkage to be established for the relationships observed in\\nour study.\\n\\na second limitation of our study concerns thneralizability of its\\nfindings with regard to the cultural environment in which it was conducted.\\nalthough our sample comprises 93 organizations, they were all german\\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. as we know from existing research\\non topics related to the aging workforce (, chiu, chan, snape, &\\nredman, 2001), the cultural background in which an organization is op-\\nerating may influence the findings. consequently, the specific german\\nsetting might have had an effect on the perception of age-diversity cli-\\nmate, for example. future studies might, therefore, want to replicate our\\nfindings in other cultural settings, such as asia or north america. more-\\nover, readers should keep in mind that our study only included small to\\nmedium-sized firms with no firm having more than 5,000 employees. to\\n\\n\\n\\nstephan a. boehm  695\\n\\ninclude companies above that size might further improve thneraliz-\\nability of the present findings.\\n\\nthird, our measure of organizational performance was obtained from\\nkey informants (i.e., the firms’ executive board members) and a perceptual\\nmeasure rather than a fully objective one. although executive board mem-\\nbers can be regarded as a good source of information on performance and\\nthe way to measure performance is a well-established one (combs ,\\n2005; delaney & huselid, 1996; kunze , 2011, 2013; wall ,\\n2004), researchers should strive to collect additional financial data, such\\nas stock measures, to assess firm performance; however, due to the fact\\nthat most companies in our sample were privately owned, nonlisted firms,\\nthis was hardly possible for this study.\\n\\nbeyond these limitations, our study offers several interesting directions\\nfor future research. first, future studies might be interested in proposing\\nand testing additional mediators for the link between age-inclusive hr\\npractices and organizational performance. discrimination, for instance,\\nmight be a promising construct to examine because age-related discrimi-\\nnatory behavior can be regarded as a severe threat to organizational per-\\nformance (chiu , 2001; duncan, loretto, & white, 2000; hassell &\\nperrewe, 1993, 1995; kunze , 2011, 2013; palmore, 1999; snape &\\nredman, 2003). the 22,857 charges of age discrimination filed in the\\nunited states in 2012 (u.s. equal employment opportunity commission,\\n2013) indicate the necessity for companies to consider how best to reduce\\nany perceptions of age discrimination in the workplace. age-inclusive hr\\npractices and a positive age-diversity climate may be promising factors\\nto reduce age discrimination and to foster cooperation and organizational\\nperformance (boehm , in press).\\n\\nsecond, future research might consider additional antecedents and\\nboundary conditions that foster and shape members’ perceptions of age-\\ndiversity climate and translate it into organizational performance and\\nemployee retention. for example, leadership behavior was proposed as\\nan important determinant of diversity climate (avery & mckay, 2010),\\nhowever, empirical work on this relationship is scarce. more specifically,\\ntransformational leadership might be an especially promising leadership\\nstyle to foster perceptions of a pronounced age-diversity climate, given its\\ngenerally positive effect in organizational settings characterized by high\\n(age-)diversity (, kearney & gebert, 2009; kunze & bruch, 2010;\\nshin & zhou, 2007). in addition, tmt attitudes, potential age stereotypes,\\nas well as top-level leadership behavior might be important antecedents\\nand moderators of the (age-)diversity climate–performance link (gilbert\\n& ivancevich, 2001; wentling, 2004).\\n\\nthird, scholars might find it worthwhile to build upon our findings and\\nto develop multilevel models of the emnce and effects of age-diversity\\n\\n\\n\\n696 personnel psychology\\n\\nclimate (see , gonzalez & denisi, 2009). for example, it might\\nbe interesting to investigate how a distinct age-diversity climate at\\nthe organizational level of analysis translates into lower-level out-\\ncomes, such as cooperation or cohesion climate (on thoup level of\\nanalysis) or individual job satisfaction or performance (on the individual\\nlevel of analysis). in sum, we hope that this study contributes to a better\\nunderstanding of the development and effects of age-diversity climate and\\nprovides a sound basis for future studies investigating this theoretically\\nand practically relevant topic.\\n'"

      " spotlight on agediversity climate the impact of ageinclusive hr practices on firmlevel outcomes personnel psychology spotlight on age-diversity climate the impact of age-inclusive hr practices on firm-level outcomes stephan. boehm university of st. gallen florian kunze university of st. gallen heike bruch university of st. gallen this study investigates the emnce and the performance effects of an age-diversity climate at the organizational level of analysis. building upon kopelman and colles climate model of firm productivity as well as cox interactional model of cultural diversity we hypothesize positive influence of ageinclusive hr practices on the development of an organization-wide agediversity climate which in turn should be directly related to collective perceptions of social exchange and indirectly to firm performance and employees collective turnover intentions. the assumed relationships are tested in sample of german small and medium-sized companies with employees participating. to circumvent common source problems information for the various constructs was gathered from different sources. to test our assumed relationships we applied structural equation modeling and executed bootstrapping procedures to test the significance of the indirect effects. we received support for all assumed relationships. the paper concludes with practical recommendations on how to establish and make use of positive age-diversity climate. due to the combined effect of low fertility rates rising life expectancy and the disproportionately large baby-boom generation born between and most countries in the western world are currently experiencing substantial demographic change of their populations which is also mirrored in the increasing age diversity we thank our action editor hui liao and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments in the review process of this article. we also acknowl the feedback and support from lisa nishii and sim sitkin. the research described in this article was supported by grants received from the myhandicap foundation from switzerland and the hans-boeckler-foundation from germany. correspondence and requests for reprints should be addressed to stephan. boehm center for disability and integration university of st. gallen rosenbtrasse ch st. gallen switzerland. wiley periodicals inc. doi. peps.  personnel psychology of their workforces. from to thoup of - to -year-old workers in the. workforce is projected to increase by. similar numbers apply to germany. from older employees will represent thrman working population largest subgroup. in many organizations different individuals from three or even four generations will work together. as consequence ways to achieve the joint gement of these diverse age groups will be key factor in the future success of companies. one important factor in reaching the high productivity of all agoups may be an organization-wide age-diversity climate best described as employees shared perceptions of an organization diversity-related policies practices and procedures in terms of age. although research on general diversity climate is apparently em ing from its embryonic stage more distinct forms of diversity-related climate perceptions have still not attracted the attention they deserve. in particular the concept of age-diversity climate has to our knowl not yet been studied in any theoretical or empirical context. given the practical importance of the demographic change and the rising age diversity in most developed countries this is serious shortcoming of the literature. as schneider ehrhart and macey argue scholars should strive for best possible match between the climate they study and the antecedents and effects they predict in order to gain high predictive validity of their model. in other words if one is interested in the role of age in the workplace it might be more revealing to develop and test nomological net of age-diversity climate than of general diversity climate. therefore this study aims to establish such new climate measure while equally investigating potential antecedents and consequences at the organizational level. first we draw from work on general diversity climate as well as that on older employees to develop sound definition and empirical validation of the age-diversity climate construct at the organizational level of analysis. second we follow recent calls to conduct studies to uncover the hr practices associated with pro-diversity climates. more specifically we will define and validate measure of age-inclusive human resource practices as potential antecedent of an stephan. boehm organizational age-diversity climate. building upon the work of kopelman brief and guzzo and applying arguments from theories of signaling and collective sensemaking we assume that human resource practices which are adjusted to an age-diverse workforce are positively related to age-diversity climate. third we strive to establish age-diversity climate as performance antecedent on the organizational level of analysis. although different types of climate have been reported to be relevant for individual- group- or unit-level outcomes no study to our knowl has investigated the organizational-level consequences of diversity climate. given the ongoing discussion on the business case for diversity this seems to be one of the major gaps in diversity climate research calling for detailed empirical inspection of across-firm differences with regard to diversityrelated performance effects. thus building upon cox interactional model of cultural diversity we will employ social exchange theory to argue for positive relation of pronounced age-diversity climate with firm-wide perceptions of social exchange which in turn relate positively to the performance of an organization as well as negatively to employees collective turnover intentions. finally by establishing model that assumes an indirect relationship of age-inclusive hr practices via age-diversity climate on company outcomes we also strive to contribute to the hrm literature. in the past decade hrm research has made significant progress in opening the black box between certain bundles of hr measures and firm performance. more specifically recent research has shed light on the role of climates as intermediating variables between hr practices and company outcomes. our study builds upon this work and extends it by introducing and validating age-inclusive hr practices as novel hr system for achieving distinct strategic goal and by exploring how age-diversity climate as new mediator translates its potential effects on firm-level outcomes such as productivity or collective turnover intentions. by doing so we also follow recent call by lepak to investigate if hr systems for specific organizational objectives exist such as fostering diversity perceptions within firms.  personnel psychology in sum our paper aims to further integrate research on both diversity climate and the hrm performance link through testing two three-path mediation relationships in sample of companies with employees. by doing so we hope to contribute toward better understanding of how inclusive hr practices especially those targeted toward age diverse employees may have an impact on firm performance and employee turnover through the creation of positive age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange. theory the hrm organizational climate firm performance link in the past decade theoretical and empirical research has proposed and demonstrated positive association between well-developed hr practices and organizational performance. most scholars agree however that instead of affecting organizational performance directly hr practices may rather lead to certain intermediate processes including desirable employee states and behaviors. kopelman were among the first to focus on the mediating role of climate in the hrm performance link. this line of thought was adopted by scholars such as ostroff and bowen who developed theoretical model proposing positive effect of hrm practices on firm performance via the creation of strong climates. they explain that in order to be effective organizations should strive for high alignment between the hr practices they design and thals they want to achieve. in the meantime scholars started to empirically test and support such hrm climate performance relationships. our study builds upon this work and translates it to the particular context of age-diversity climate which we propose as an important mediator in the age-inclusive hr practices firm performance relationship.  age-diversity climate defined work on diversity climate can be traced back to the original definition of reichers and schneider who defined organizational climate as shared perceptions of the way things are around here.  the authors describe organizational climate perceptions as evolving as part of stephan. boehm sensemaking process in which salient workplace stimuli are retrieved and interpreted by the workforce. if shared among organizational members joint perceptions of distinct climate may evolve. most scholars agree with schneider and reichers that climate is most meaningful if it is specified in terms of having distinct referent for example climate for safety or for cooperation. most relevant for our study on age-diversity climate is the concept of general diversity climate which was introduced by scholars such as kossek and zonia and mor barak. gelfand defined it as employees shared perceptions of the policies practices and procedures that implicitly and explicitly communicate the extent to which fostering and maintaining diversity and eliminating discrimination is priority in the organization.  based on this definition we understand age-diversity climate as specific form of morneral diversity climate and define it as organizational members shared perceptions of the fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of employees of all agoups with regard to all relevant organizational practices policies procedures and rewards. in practice it covers members joint impression that their organization favors an age-diverse workforce and takes active steps to recruit promote and retain employees of all agoups. moreover it reflects shared conviction that age is no potential stumbling block in making progress within the organization. in our opinion it is important to stress that such pronounced age-diversity climate reflects an age-neutral organizational behavior toward all groups that is not only should older employees feel free from age-related discrimination but so should younger workers. age-inclusive hr practices in line with prior research we argue that in order to achieve distinct climate organizations must install suitable and focused hr practices. therefore we draw from work on hr practices for an aging workforce that have been discussed in both research and practice over the past two decades. most scholars dealing with this topic have proposed to introduce no single isolated practices but certain bundles of age-related hr practices that are interrelated internally consistent and based on certain organizational personnel psychology logic. however the majority of the existing studies on age related hr practices were rather practice oriented and did typically not include scale validation. in addition almost all existing studies focused on hr practices designed only for older workers such as targeting older employees to update current job skills. as we are interested in hr practices that might nurture positive agediversity climate we felt the need to develop and validate new scale that reflects this claim of age inclusion. in order to do so we still drew from existing work on hr practices for older employees and adapted it to the needs of fostering an age diverse workforce. second we drew from avery and mckay listing of practices likely to be associated with pro-diversity work climates as further basis for our item development. third we combined these lines of research with the literature on strategic human resource systems that typically argues that hr systems may impact organizational outcomes directly and indirectly by influencing employees skills and knowl bases employees motivation and effort as well as employees opportunities to contribute to organizational goals. based on this conceptualization we propose that in order to have maximum effect bundles of age-inclusive hr practices should relate to all three hr policy domains. consequently they should equally foster all employees knowl skills and abilities motivation and effort and opportunities to contribute. with regard to hr policy domain age-inclusive hr practices might include age-neutral recruiting activities as well as equal access to training and further education for all agoups. in this way organizations can make sure that all agoups have the necessary knowl and skills to perform their jobs successfully and ultimately contribute to firm performance. with regard to hr policy domain ageinclusive hr practices might include equal opportunities to be promoted transferred and to make further career steps irrespective of one age. in addition training and educating managers on how to deal with an agediverse workforce and how to respond to the needs of different agoups might also be an important lever of employee motivation. by ging in such practices firms can ensure that all agoups do not only have the skills but also the necessary motivation to contribute to joint goals. stephan. boehm finally with regard to hr policy domain age-inclusive hr practices might include the promotion of an age-friendly organizational culture that promotes and values the contribution of all agoups. such an age-inclusive culture should help to provide all employees with the courage to speak up to bring in their own ideas and to help improve organizational creativity and effectiveness. in sum organizations interested in effectively managing an age-diverse workforce should make sure that their age-inclusive hr practices ideally cover all three hr policy domains and take into account the needs of both younger and older employees and not exclusively those of certain agoups. relationship of age-inclusive hr practices with age-diversity climate building upon theories of signaling and collective sensemaking we hypothesize that organizational members perceive such age-inclusive hr measures that are targeted toward the development of an age-diverse and age-embracing workforce. den hartog explain how hr policies can function as signal of the organization intention toward its workers. similarly bowen and ostroff describe how hrm systems may explicate to employees what is collectively desired and expected from them. if employees experience that newly hired colles in their department are coming from all agoups and that employees have equal opportunities to be promoted and to get training then they may perceive these as clear signals that the organization is interested in attracting and retaining an age-diverse workforce. in addition hr practices that educate executives about the need for an inclusive leadership behavior as well as an appreciation of the particular contribution of all agoups may be interpreted as clear signals of an age-friendly climate. organizational members are believed to interpret these signals and to collectively make sense of such age-inclusive behavioral guidelines. as the management is taking credible interest in the proactive gement of employees of all agoups it can be expected that the organizational members themselves understand that the fostering of age diversity as well as the prevention of any age-related discrimination are major corporatals. this should have positive impact on both their own behavior toward members of different agoups and on the shared age-diversity climate within the organization. on the basis of these arguments we suggest the following hypothesis age-inclusive hr practices will be positively related to respondents perceptions of age-diversity climate.  personnel psychology relationship of age-diversity climate with company performance and collective turnover intentions via collective perceptions of social exchange in order to argue for potentially positive effect of age-diversity climate on company performance and collective turnover intentions we generally draw from kopelman climate model of firm productivity. this model proposes that climate impacts firm performance through its positive effects on desirable cognitive and affective states as well as relevant organizational behaviors. similarly cox imcd argues that positive diversity climate should first affect individual affective and performance outcomes which in turn should have positive impact on first-level and second-level organizational outcomes. in the meantime there is also considerable empirical support for such positive relationships of diversity climate with collective performance or customer satisfaction as well as for negative relationship with turnover intentions. in our study we build upon this line of research and further specify it by introducing social exchange relationships of the employees with their companies as an often assumed however seldom tested mediator of the diversity climate firm outcomes link. relationship of age-diversity climate with collective perceptions of social exchange. if pronounced age-diversity climate exists within firm employees are more likely to perceive fair treatment by their organization. they will experience that no preferential treatment is given to any employee based on his or her age and that all agoups receive equal levels of support by the organization expressed in equal access to training comparable development and promotion opportunities and so on. this sense of being taken care of regardless of their age should foster all employees feelings of justice trust in their employer belief that the organization significantly invests in them long-term orientation toward their employment relationship and conviction that they receive socioemotional support and not only financial compensation. all these potential implications of distinct age-diversity climate in the workplace are important antecedents or even characteristics of social exchange relationships. as described by blau social exchanges involve mutual obligations such that when one party is doing favor to another there is an expectancy of some future return. as the exact form and point in time of the future return are often diffuse trust and long-term orientation are key to social exchange relationships. perceived justice also has been found to be an important predictor of high-quality social exchange relationships which involve mutual investments between both partners as well as concern for the interest of the other party in the respective relationship. in sum organizations characterized by pronounced age-diversity climate are more likely to be perceived as just trustworthy investing in its employees and long-term orientated which should foster employees collective perception of strong social exchange relationship between themselves and their employer. this assumption is in line with theoretical work of shore who proposed that inclusive climates should trigger perceptions of fairness and trust which are important for developing social exchange relationships. moreover from an empirical point of view shore showed that employees who perceive their organization to be committed toward them reported higher levels of social exchange with their firm. takeuchi found evidence for such relationship also on the collective level of analysis indicating that employees can develop shared social exchange perceptions within their establishments or organizations. based on these arguments we hypothesize hypothesis age-diversity climate will be positively related to collective perceptions of social exchange. relationship of collective perceptions of social exchange with company performance and collective turnover intentions. taking this process one step further employees should not stop by just perceiving htened level of social exchange in the workplace. compared to more short-term and impersonal economic exchanges social exchanges are based on norm of reciprocity which implies that people should help those who have helped them and people should not injure those who have helped them. transferred to an organizational context employees perceiving high social exchange should reciprocate their organizations efforts through own intensified work-related endeavors with positive effects for their work performance their organizational commitment and their attachment. supporting this assumption tsui pearce porter and tripoli showed that employees who perceive their relationship with their organization as characterized by mutual investments performed better on core tasks personnel psychology exhibited more pronounced organizational citizenship behaviors and reported higher intent to stay. in addition positive perceptions of high social exchange should not only increase employees willingness to contribute to organizational goals but should also positively affect their willingness to support colles. takeuchi explain how high degrees of social exchange should spur social support among coworkers leading to positive synes between group members and ultimately to increased organizational performance. in sum balanced fair and reciprocal relationship between employees and the organization seems likely to trigger behaviors above and beyond the call of duty with positive effects for coworkers customers and other relevant organizational stakeholders that ultimately impact firm performance and collective turnover intentions. there is also empirical work that has shown that social exchange perceptions and performance reduced turnover are related on both the individual and collective level of analysis. as most important finding for our study takeuchi demonstrated positive relation between the degree of social exchange collectively perceived in an establishment and establishment performance. based on the theoretical and empirical arguments presented above we propose the following hypothesis collective perceptions of social exchange will be positively related to company performance. hypothesis collective perceptions of social exchange will be negatively related to collective turnover intentions. mediation hypotheses hypothesis predicts positive influence of age-inclusive hr practices on age-diversity climate. hypothesis predicts positive relationship between age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange. hypotheses and predict positive relationship between collective perceptions of social exchange and company performance and negative one with collective turnover intentions respectively. together these hypotheses specify model in which age-inclusive hr measures indirectly influence company performance and collective turnover intentions by contributing to organizational members joint perception of pronounced age-diversity climate and social exchange level. this view is consistent with recent hrm research that has consistently made use stephan. boehm of climates as mediators between bundles of hr practices and firm performance. by introducing age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange as potential mediators we build upon this work and hope to shed more light on the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and organizational outcomes which has received an insufficient amount of attention to date. consequently we propose the following three-path mediation hypotheses hypothesis the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and company performance is mediated through firm agediversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange. hypothesis the relationship between age-inclusive hr practices and collective turnover intentions is mediated through firm age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange. this study investigated the emnce and effects of age-diversity climate at the organizational level of analysis. more specifically we developed an integrated model attempting to specify how age-inclusive hr practices may impact employees shared age-diversity climate perceptions which in turn should be directly related to collective perceptions of social exchange and indirectly to both firm performance and collective turnover intentions. building upon existing work on diversity climate we first developed theoretical understanding and empirical measurement of firm agediversity climate. next we developed measure of age-inclusive hr practices and drew from work of kopelman to explain how such organization-wide hr practices might positively influence members age-diversity climate perceptions through processes of signaling and collective sensemaking. thirdly building upon cox imcd and social exchange theory we linked age-diversity climate to collective perceptions of social exchange which in turn in this alternative model all proposed relationships remained significant on level. stephan. boehm should predict firm performance and collective turnover intentions. finally we argued for and tested two full mediation models of age-inclusive hr practices leading to firm performance and collective turnover intentions through their effects on age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange. in sum we found support for all of our hypotheses. we believe that these results contribute to the literature by substantiating and extending prior findings in at least four ways. first with regard to the diversity climate literature one important contribution of our study can be identified in terms of describing validating and empirically testing age-diversity climate as special form of the morneral diversity climate construct. this seems significant for at least two reasons. on the one hand there is clear research trend to describe more specified forms of climate instead of general work climates as these allow for more detailed insights into climate-related forms of organizational behavior. on the other hand given the ongoing demographic change in most industrialized economies age diversity can be expected to become one of the most relevant diversity categories in the very near future. moreover as recent research shows increasing levels of age diversity are far from having just positive influence on employees well-being and on firm performance. consequently both scholarly research on and the practical promotion and nurturing of distinct age-diversity climate seem highly promising. our second contribution to the climate and hr literature concerns the analysis of age-inclusive hr practices as distinct driver of htened levels of age-diversity climate. although scholars like pugh and avery and mckay mention that hr practices were repeatedly proposed as potential sources of diversity climates actual studies on this relation are scarce. most empirical research deals instead with individual employees demographic characteristics such as their gender or ethnicity or the demographic composition of the entire workforce as drivers for organizational members diversity climate perceptions. our study differs significantly from this approach as it investigates the influence of actual hr practices on age-diversity climate. for practitioners this might provide the advantage of having toolkit on hand to help effectively manage an age-diverse workforce as supplement to focusing on recruiting issues. in this regard our study also contributes to the literature on personnel psychology age-related hr practices which has mostly been descriptive to date and has focused more on the configuration and dissemination than on the performance consequences of such measures. in addition existing scales seem to have been exclusively focused on the productive gement of older employees. although this is an important premise for the long-term gement of an aging workforce it might not be enough for the sustainable success of an age-diverse workforce. therefore we theoretically developed empirically validated and practically tested new measure for an age-inclusive hr system. by providing empirical support for the hypothesis that age-inclusive hr bundles are relevant for performance and employee retention this paper offers companies an even stronger motivation to actually install and foster such practices that enable an effective collaboration of both younger and older employees in the workplace. by doing so we also followed call by lepak and demonstrated that specific hr systems might indeed relate to specific organizational objectives such as fostering positive diversity perceptions within firms. our third contribution to the climate literature relates to our two outcome variables firm performance and collective turnover intentions. as described by mckay there is dearth of quantitative studies that investigate the organizational-level performance outcomes of diversity climate. most of the existing studies have either established the consequences of diversity climate on thoup or unit level. with our dataset that combines data from the corporate level of analysis with aggregated data collected at the individual level of analysis we were able to test and affirm the positive relation between diverse work climates and firm performance as well as the negative relation to collective turnover intentions across companies thereby supporting business case for diversity. our fourth and final contribution pertains to the linkage of the climate and the hr literature. our study corroborated prior findings implying mediating role of organizational climates in the hr practices firm performance link. we built upon and extended these findings by introducing age-diversity climate as relevant mediator and thereby also better connected the strategic hr and the diversity literature. indeed supported by bootstrapping analyses we even found full mediation of age-diversity climate and collective perceptions of social exchange in the age-inclusive hr practices-firm performance relationship. we are however aware of the fact that there might be additional potential mediators of this relationship. as age-inclusive hr practices are developed to improve employees stephan. boehm skills their motivation and their opportunities to contribute there might be further mediating processes that explain the underlying hr-performance relationship. for instance investing in training and knowl acquisition for employees of all agoups might help the employees to develop better product innovation or customer service competency. nevertheless we believe that diversity climate is an especially powerful mediator as it reflects workforce potential to work together effectively and to include people irrespective of their demographic background probably one of the most important triggers of long-term firm success. practical implications most corporate leaders in industrialized countries seem to have realized that the demographic change with aging populations low birth rates and large cohorts of future retirees will have tremendous implications for their firms. hr managers in particular are increasingly aware of the fact that they bear an immense responsibility to manage the challs of the ongoing demographic shift in order to secure the long-term productivity of their companies. our study results may support them in these endeavors. first practitioners should be aware of the fact that age-inclusive hr practices are promising tool in managing an aging workforce. as our study has shown potential elements of such age-inclusive hr bundles are age-neutral recruiting policies equal access to training for all agoups age-neutral career and promotion systems initiatives to educate managers about leading age-diversity in the workplace as well as the promotion of an age-inclusive corporate culture. although these measures should not be regarded as an exhaustive list they provide practitioners with good starting point in order to effectively manage employees from all age groups. moreover as our analyses indicate the introduction of such ageinclusive hr systems seems to be beneficial for all organizations and not just for those characterized by high average age or high age diversity of their workforce. second hr managers as well as leadership personnel throughout the firm should be conscious of the crucial role of positive age-diversity climate in translating hr measures into performance and employee retention. consequently the fostering of high levels of proage-diverse climate seems very valuable. in addition to investing in hr practices that affect the age-diversity climate companies could also think about influencing it in additional ways. in this regard pugh have suggested actively help their employees interpret what they see by pointing to the policies practices and procedures that contributed to creating and sustaining diverse workforce.  in other words firms should not only install age-inclusive hr practices but also actively speak about them increase their employees awareness of them and ultimately make these practices key component of their so-called corporate dna. by doing so they should be able to promote even higher levels of age-diversity climate which in turn should positively and sustainably impact their bottom line. limitations and future research directions although this study profits from numerous methodological strhs there are several limitations that should be noted when interpreting the study findings. first this was cross-sectional design study in nature which prevents us from drawing final conclusions about causality. although we hope to have provided convincing theoretical arguments for the described directions of influence future studies should aim to overcome this limitation by applying longitudinal research design. this seems especially relevant for study hypothesis which investigated the impact of ageinclusive hr practices on age-diversity climate. it might be particularly fruitful to study the introduction of age-inclusive hr practices at one point in time and to measure the development in members age-diversity perceptions at later points in time. in addition quasi-experimental research designs in which participating organizations are randomly or post-hoc assigned to treatments might allow causal linkage to be established for the relationships observed in our study. second limitation of our study concerns thneralizability of its findings with regard to the cultural environment in which it was conducted. although our sample comprises organizations they were all german small and medium-sized enterprises. as we know from existing research on topics related to the aging workforce the cultural background in which an organization is operating may influence the findings. consequently the specific german setting might have had an effect on the perception of age-diversity climate for example. future studies might therefore want to replicate our findings in other cultural settings such as asia or north america. moreover readers should keep in mind that our study only included small to medium-sized firms with no firm having more than employees. to stephan. boehm include companies above that size might further improve thneralizability of the present findings. third our measure of organizational performance was obtained from key informants and perceptual measure rather than fully objective one. although executive board members can be regarded as good source of information on performance and the way to measure performance is well-established one researchers should strive to collect additional financial data such as stock measures to assess firm performance however due to the fact that most companies in our sample were privately owned nonlisted firms this was hardly possible for this study. beyond these limitations our study offers several interesting directions for future research. first future studies might be interested in proposing and testing additional mediators for the link between age-inclusive hr practices and organizational performance. discrimination for instance might be promising construct to examine because age-related discriminatory behavior can be regarded as severe threat to organizational performance. the charges of age discrimination filed in the united states in indicate the necessity for companies to consider how best to reduce any perceptions of age discrimination in the workplace. age-inclusive hr practices and positive age-diversity climate may be promising factors to reduce age discrimination and to foster cooperation and organizational performance. second future research might consider additional antecedents and boundary conditions that foster and shape members perceptions of agediversity climate and translate it into organizational performance and employee retention. for example leadership behavior was proposed as an important determinant of diversity climate however empirical work on this relationship is scarce. more specifically transformational leadership might be an especially promising leadership style to foster perceptions of pronounced age-diversity climate given its generally positive effect in organizational settings characterized by high diversity. in addition tmt attitudes potential age stereotypes as well as top-level leadership behavior might be important antecedents and moderators of the diversity climate performance link. third scholars might find it worthwhile to build upon our findings and to develop multilevel models of the emnce and effects of age-diversity personnel psychology climate. for example it might be interesting to investigate how distinct age-diversity climate at the organizational level of analysis translates into lower-level outcomes such as cooperation or cohesion climate or individual job satisfaction or performance. in sum we hope that this study contributes to better understanding of the development and effects of age-diversity climate and provides sound basis for future studies investigating this theoretically and practically relevant topic. \n",
