(peters, 1975; wenzel,\\n1967). acedia was considered to be one of t vices and\\nwas closely tied to the avoidance of formal duties among\\ncatholic monks. nicknamed the “noonday demon”, acedia\\nwas thought to strike around midday, distracting monks\\nfrom their work and tempting them to leave the monastery\\nin search of stimulation (ponticus, 2006). catholic monk john\\ncassian (2000) described acedia as making monks either idle\\nor restless. he writes, “[acedia] either allows [the monk] to stay\\nin his cell without any spiritual progress, in as it were a state of\\ninactivity and surrender, or drives him out from there and\\nmakes him, in addition, unstable and feckless” (p. 221).\\n\\nthese early accounts suggest that little has changed with\\nrespect to how people experience boredom at work. if\\ncassian’s description of acedia were updated with references\\nto contemporary workplaces, it might refer to “cubicles”\\ninstead of “cells” and rather than a “monk” being “unstable\\nand feckless”, an “employee” might be “distracting and inef-\\nfective”. the link between boredom and counterproductivity\\nhas carried through to today, with researchers recognizing\\nthat feeling bored may result in distraction at work. for exam-\\nple, trait boredom, or a chronic propensity to feel bored,\\nrelates to poor performance, absenteeism, turnover, withdra-\\nwal, and deviance (bruusema, kessler, & spector, 2011; kass,\\nvodanovich, & callendar, 2001; watt & hargis, 2010).\\n\\ndespite etymological and contemporary associations\\nbetween feeling bored and employee effectiveness,\\n\\norganizational research on state boredom is limited. this\\nmay be due to the fact that the organizational behaviour\\nliterature (and psychology more broadly) is wrought with\\ndivnt and sometimes contradictory definitions of feeling\\nbored in addition to suboptimal scales (fisher, 1993; reijseger\\n, 2013; vodanovich, 2003). we sought to contribute to\\norganizational research on state boredom by developing a\\nmeasure that is consistent with a theoretically derived defini-\\ntion and that builds on the strhs of existing scales while\\naddressing their limitations. in the sections discussed next, we\\nsynthesize theories and definitions of state boredom with the\\naim of building consensus towards a unifying definition. then\\nwe review how state boredom is typically measured, outline\\nthe implications for testing organizational theory, and explain\\nwhy a new scale is needed. finally, using hinkin’s (1998)\\ndeductive approach to scale development, we provide valida-\\ntion evidence for our measure across five studies using 10\\nsamples.\\n\\ndefining state boredom\\n\\nthe word boredom itself did not appear in the ish lan-\\nguage until the mid-19th century. dickens’s (1853/2003) novel\\nbleak house is often cited as the first printed use of the term.\\ndespite the fact that the word “boredom” has been around for\\nover 100 years and the concept (acedia) has been around for\\ncenturies, contemporary scholars have yet to agree on a defi-\\nnition of feeling bored. in psychology, existing definitions\\ndiv from one another quite severely. for example, it has\\nbeen defined as “low arousal and dissatisfaction” (mikulas &\\nvodanovich, 1993, p. 3), “subjective monotony and. . . frustra-\\ntion” (hill & perkins, 1985, p. 235), “effortful maintenance of\\nattention” (leary, rogers, canfield, & coe, 1986, p. 968), and\\n\\ncontact patricia l. baratta  \\neuropean journal of work and organizational psychology\\n2018, vol. 27, no. 4, 477–492\\n\\n\\n© 2018 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“feeling unchalld and perceiving one’s activities as mean-\\ningless” (van tilburg & igou, 2012, p. 182). these examples\\nillustrate that there can be little overlap in the content of\\nmany definitions, with some arguing for antithetical content\\n(, low arousal versus frustration).\\n\\nthe absence of an accepted definition makes it difficult to\\nbuild a theory on how state boredom relates to organizational\\nvariables because researchers who define it differently are\\nessentially theorizing about different constructs. given the\\ndisparate content of these definitions, it is unlikely that\\nresearchers would expect each of these constructs to exhibit\\ncomparable associations with other variables. for example, an\\nemployee who experiences meaninglessness and lack of chal-\\nl may demonstrate a very different pattern of behaviours\\nthan an employee who is frustrated. divnce in how bore-\\ndom is defined limits researchers’ ability to build a unified\\ntheory identifying causes and outcomes of feeling bored as\\nwell as mechanisms explaining why it predicts certain\\nvariables.\\n\\nto resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted a compre-\\nhensive review of the boredom literature to build consensus\\ntowards a definition. our definition integrates the most com-\\nmonly discussed and theoretically relevant components of\\nstate boredom. our review suggested that state boredom\\nhas been approached using multiple theoretical perspectives,\\nprimarily psychodynamic, arousal, and attentional theories\\n(eren, 2016; fahlman, mercer-lynn, flora, & eastwood, 2013;\\nraffaelli, mills, & christoff, 2017). we searched all peer-\\nreviewed articles through the end of 2017 that specified\\n“bored*” as a key word. our search resulted in 661 hits, of\\nwhich 126 included a definition of boredom. we coded each\\ndefinition based on its themes or components and identified\\nfour major themes—disgement (n = 79; 63%), a negative\\nor unpleasant state (n = 69; 55%), low arousal (n = 52; 41%),\\nand inattention (n = 27; 21%)—and six infrequent themes—\\nmeaninglessness (n = 16; 13%), distorted time perception\\n(n = 16; 13%), monotony (n = 7; 6%), attribution (n = 8; 6%),\\nhigh arousal (n = 8; 6%), and feeling under-challd (n = 6;\\n5%). in the next few sections, we review each major theme\\nand integrate them into a definition of state boredom.\\n\\nstate boredom and disgement\\n\\npsychodynamic theorists consider state boredom to be an\\nunpleasant state resulting from an unfulfilled urge for psychic\\nstimulation (fenichel, 1951; gabriel, 1988; greenson, 1953;\\nlewinsky, 1943). they propose that boredom serves as a\\ndefence mechanism that prevents individuals from acting on\\nimpulses. more specifically, bored individuals are thought to\\nhave an intense need for psychic stimulation, but cannot\\nspecify what they want because the urge has been uncon-\\nsciously repressed. as a result, they experience dissatisfaction\\nwith their current situation and an aimless tension to ge\\nin rewarding activity (fenichel, 1951; lewinsky, 1943). “this\\nuncertainty and vagueness about one’s own wishes is. . . char-\\nacteristic of boredom” (lewinsky, 1943, p. 148).\\n\\nmost contemporary definitions are consistent with these\\nideas as they describe boredom as feeling dissatisfied, unin-\\nterested, or withdrawn from the environment (, elpidorou,\\n\\n2017; farmer & sundb 1986; fisher, 1993; vafeas & hughes,\\n2016). more recently, eastwood and colles (,\\neastwood, frischen, fenske, & smilek, 2012; fahlman ,\\n2013) defined state boredom as “the aversive experience of\\nwanting, but being unable to ge in stimulating and satis-\\nfying activity” (p. 69). in line with psychodynamic theorists,\\nthey further specified that in addition to “wanting but being\\nunable”, the bored individual is “unaware of what it is that one\\ndesires” (eastwood , 2012, p. 484). similarly, mann and\\ncadman (2014) suggested that bored individuals are unable to\\nspecify what to do, stating that “boredom stems from a situa-\\ntion where none of the possible things that a person can\\nrealistically do appeal to the person in question” (p. 165).\\ntaken together, psychodynamic theory suggests that disen-\\ngagement is a key component of state boredom, which we\\ndefine as a longing to ge in an unspecified satisfying\\nactivity.\\n\\nstate boredom and unpleasant low arousal\\n\\naccording to arousal theory, state boredom occurs when our\\nphysiological arousal falls below an optimal level (fiske &\\nmaddi, 1961; hebb, 1955; o’hanlon, 1981). decreased arousal\\nis thought to result from under-stimulating environments,\\nleading to a mismatch between one’s current and desired\\nlevel of arousal. because individuals are motivated to maintain\\nan optimal level of stimulation, individuals who experience\\narousal below this level perceive it to be unpleasant\\n(berlyne, 1960; fiske & maddi, 1961; hebb, 1955; o’hanlon,\\n1981). overall then, arousal theory suggests that state bore-\\ndom is an unpleasant, low arousal state.\\n\\nin alignment with arousal theory, organizational research-\\ners stipulate that boredom occurs when the work context is\\nunder-stimulating (reijseger , 2013; skowronski, 2012; van\\nder heijden, schepers, & nijssen, 2012). early organizational\\nresearch on state boredom focused on routine factory jobs\\nand vigilance tasks as feeling bored was thought to result\\nfrom monotonous stimuli with under-arousing properties\\n(loukidou, lou-clarke, & daniels, 2009; o’hanlon, 1981). most\\ncontemporary definitions of state boredom define it in relation\\nto low physiological arousal, involving feelings of weariness,\\nlethargy, fatigue, and drowsiness (geiwitz, 1966; greenson,\\n1953; levy, 1984; marsh, 1983; mikulas & vodonovich, 1993).\\nfor example, hamilton (1981) referred to it as a “low arousal,\\ndrowsy sort of boredom” (p. 358).\\n\\na few researchers contend that state boredom is accom-\\npanied by increased arousal (berlyne, 1960; hill & perkins,\\n1985) and qualitative data show that bored individuals some-\\ntimes report feeling restless alongside lethargy (harris, 2000;\\nmartin, sadlo, & stew, 2006; vandewiele, 1980). it seems logi-\\ncally and physiologically inconsistent to suggest that state\\nboredom comprises both high and low arousal; however,\\narousal theory provides insight into why this occurs. arousal\\ntheory asserts that people are motivated to maintain an opti-\\nmal level of arousal (fiske & maddi, 1961; hebb, 1955); thus, to\\nmaintain this level, bored individuals who experience lethar-\\ngic, low arousal may make efforts to increase arousal either\\nthrough changing their environment or by increasing their\\ninternal level of physiological arousal (burn, 2017; mikulas &\\n\\n478 p. l. baratta and j. r. spence\\n\\n\\n\\nvodanovich, 1993; o’hanlon, 1981). reports of feeling restless\\nwhen bored are associated with situations involving constraint\\n(geiwitz, 1966; martin , 2006; mikulas & vodanovich, 1993)\\nand may be indicative of individuals trying to escape boredom\\nthrough self-stimulation since changing the environment is\\nnot possible. we contend that whereas low arousal is an\\nessential component of state boredom, high arousal is likely\\na result of attempting to escape it and is, therefore, an out-\\ncome of feeling bored.\\n\\nin addition to low arousal, arousal theory states that boredom\\nis experienced as unpleasant (because arousal is below the\\noptimal level). this is consistent with circumplex models of affect\\nin which affective states are positioned around a circumplex\\nalong two orthogonal continuums: valence and activation\\n(russell, 1980). these continuums result in a circumplex divided\\ninto four quadrants: activation/pleasant, activation/unpleasant,\\ndeactivation/pleasant, and deactivation/unpleasant (feldman\\nbarrett & russell, 1998). state boredom is thought to inhabit\\nthe deactivation/unpleasant quadrant (reijseger , 2013;\\nschaufeli & salanova, 2014; vogel-walcutt, fiorella, carper, &\\nschatz, 2012). states that load similarly on the two continuums\\narouped in the same quadrant, with boredom being plotted\\nalongside drowsiness, sluggishness, and tiredness in the same\\ndeactivation/unpleasant quadrant (russell, 1980; yik, russell, &\\nstr, 2011). this reaffirms the idea that unpleasant, low arou-\\nsal is a critical component of boredom, which we define as a\\nnegative, deactivated state that is manifested in emotions such as\\nweariness and lethargy.\\n\\nstate boredom and inattention\\n\\nattentional theories suggest that boredom occurs when sustain-\\ning attention is effortful (culp, 2006; eastwood, 2012; fahlman\\n, 2013; hunter & eastwood, 2016; leary , 1986). individuals\\nfeel bored when they cannot ge attention with external or\\ninternal stimuli required for participating in satisfying activity or\\nwhen they need to exert conscious effort to maintain attention to\\nincrease task gement (eastwood , 2012). evidence of the\\nrole of attention in boredom is found in cases of individuals with\\nmild traumatic brain injury who suffered damage to brain areas\\nimplicated in attention. these individuals report feeling bored\\nmore frequently and have higher levels of trait boredom\\n(goldb& danckert, 2013; kreutzer, seel, & gourley, 2001; as\\ncited in hunter & eastwood, 2016). other research has found that\\nindividuals high in trait boredom experience more attentional\\nlapses and day-to-day attentional errors, such as zoning out and\\nmisplacing keys (malkovsky, merrifield, goldb & danckert,\\n2012). qualitative data show that bored individuals report inatten-\\ntion,mindwandering, anddaydreaming (game, 2007; harris, 2000;\\nmarsh, 1983; martin , 2006), and tasks that require sustained\\nattention like vigilance tasks are rated as boring (london, schubert,\\n& washburn, 1972; scerbo, greenwald, & sawin, 1993).\\n\\nmany contemporary definitions of state boredom include an\\nattentional component in which the bored individual has difficulty\\nconcentrating and/or maintaining attention (crockett, myhre, &\\nrokke, 2015; fisher, 1993; harju & hakanen, 2016; isacescu &\\ndanckert, 2016). culp (2006) described it as a “lack of attentional\\ninterest” (p. 999), and leary  (1986) positioned it as “an\\naffective consequence of effortful maintenance of attention” (p.\\n\\n968). overall, attentional theories suggest that inattention is an\\nintegral component of state boredom, which we define as an\\ninability to focus attention or difficulty in maintaining attention.\\n\\nan integrated definition of state boredom\\n\\ntogether, we define state boredom as a lethargic, deactivated\\nnegative state (unpleasant low arousal) in which one is unable\\nto focus attention (inattention) and experiences a longing to\\nge in an unspecified satisfying activity (disgement).\\nthis definition reflects the higher-order multidimensional\\nstructure of state boredom, which comprises three compo-\\nnents. multidimensional constructs have several distinct,\\nrelated dimensions that are treated as a single, higher-order\\ntheoretical concept (edwards, 2001). they are understood in\\nterms of their dimensions and do not exist independently of\\nthem. we expect that state boredom is a higher-order con-\\nstruct that manifests itself in experiences of disgement,\\nunpleasant low arousal, and inattention (baratta & spence,\\n2015; law, wong, & mobley, 1998). in this structure, the dis-\\ntinct, but related dimensions of disgement, unpleasant\\nlow arousal, and inattention are collectively referred to as state\\nboredom. figure 1 displays the expected factor structure.\\n\\nthe measurement of state boredom\\n\\nin the current paper, our goal was to measure the experience\\nof feeling bored. some existing measures of boredom do not\\nmeasure the discrete, episodic construct of state boredom,\\nand instead focus on dispositional or environmental charac-\\nteristics. the boredom proneness scale (bps; farmer &\\nsundb 1986) is used frequently, but was designed to\\nassess trait boredom or a chronic predisposition to feeling\\nbored. whereas trait boredom is dispositional and stable\\nover time, state boredom is a momentary state that fluctuates\\nin response to situations. although individuals high in trait\\nboredom feel bored more often, trait measures provide little\\ninsight into how bored one is at a given moment or the\\naffective experience of feeling bored (van hooff & van hooft,\\n2014). most other scales, such as lee’s (1986) job boredom\\nscale (ljbs), restrict the measurement of boredom to specific\\ncontexts and were not designed to measure how bored one is\\ncurrently (vodanovich, 2003). the ljbs (lee, 1986), for exam-\\nple, includes items like “how well do you like the work that\\nyou do?”, illustrating that these scales are better-suited for\\n\\nfigure 1. higher-order multidimensional factor structure of state boredom.\\n\\neuropean journal of work and organizational psychology 479\\n\\n\\n\\nassessing overall perceptions of a particular context and not\\nhow bored one is at a given moment.\\n\\norganizational researchers have adapted existing measures\\nto reflect state-like qualities, but these measures suffer from\\nconstruct contamination as they confound state boredom\\nwith antecedents like work characteristics and affective and\\nbehavioural consequences (, bauer & spector, 2015;\\nguglielmi, simbula, mazzetti, tabanelli, & bonfiglioli, 2013;\\nreijseger , 2013; van der heijden , 2012; van wyk,\\nde beer, pienaar, & schaufeli, 2016). for instance, guglielmi\\n (2013) measured boredom using items that reflect\\nunder-stimulating work characteristics like skill underutiliza-\\ntion (“i feel that i am working below my abilities most of the\\ntime”) and low task variety (“many things i have to do are\\nrepetitive and monotonous”). reijseger  (2013) created\\nthe dutch boredom scale, which captures “affective, cognitive,\\nand behavioural reactions” (p. 509) to work boredom. for\\nexample, one item, “i tend to do other things during my\\nwork”, overlaps with counterproductive work behaviour, a\\npotential outcome of feeling bored. the inclusion of these\\nitems is problematic when conducting research linking bore-\\ndom to organizational variables as overlapping content\\nbetween measures of conceptually distinct constructs can\\nlead to inflated correlations (bozeman & perrewé, 2001).\\n\\nsome measures are content deficient as they fail to capture\\nall of boredom’s dimensions. reijseger  (2013) defined\\nboredom as “a state of low arousal and dissatisfaction” (p.\\n509), but did not include items that directly measure this.\\ninstead, one item, “during work time i daydream”, was\\nincluded to indirectly tap into unpleasant low arousal as\\nthey argued that daydreaming is a manifestation of low arou-\\nsal. similarly, van hooff and van hooft’s (2014) measure of\\nwork boredom, although useful for gauging perceptions of\\nboring work, does not include items that directly tap into\\nthe affective component of boredom (unpleasant low arousal).\\n\\nto date, the multidimensional state boredom scale (msbs;\\nfahlman , 2013) is the only validated multidimensional mea-\\nsure of state boredom. the msbs is a 29-item measure that\\nassesses state boredom along five dimensions: disgement,\\nlow arousal, high arousal, time perception, and inattention.\\nalthough the msbs is comprehensive, it may be too broad as it\\nincorporates high arousal and time perception as dimensions of\\nboredom when they may be more theoretically consistent as out-\\ncomes (see casini & macar, 1999; hansen & trope, 2013; mikulas &\\nvodanovich, 1993; for supporting arguments).moreover, themsbs\\ndisgement and low arousal dimensions include content\\nbeyond their definitions. some of the disgement items\\ndescribe potential causes of feeling bored, such as constraint (“i\\nam stuck in a situation that i feel is irrelevant”) or routinization (,\\n“everything seems repetitive and routine tome”). routinework, for\\nexample, may lead some, but not all, individuals to feel bored; for\\nsome, it leads to creativity (ohly, sonnentag, & pluntke, 2006).\\nsimilarly, the low arousal items reflect sadness (, “i feel\\ndown”), which is distinct from feelings of lethargy indicative of\\nfeeling bored. the sadness octant in the circumplex model is\\nadjacent to the tiredness octant in which boredom is grouped,\\nhighlighting that although these states are related, they should be\\ntreated as distinct (yik , 2011). we sought to address the\\nlimitations of existing scales by developing a state boredom\\n\\nmeasure that is conceptually consistent with our theoretically\\nderived definition.\\n\\noverview of studies\\n\\nwe followed hinkin’s (1998) recommendations for scale develop-\\nment and present the results of these studies in three phases:\\nphase 1 describes the item generation stage wherein we created\\na large pool of boredom items and reduced them to an 11-item\\nscale. phase 2 tested the scale’s psychometric properties andphase\\n3 provides convnt and discriminant validity evidence.\\n\\nphase 1: item generation and reduction\\n\\nitem generation\\n\\nwnerated a pool of items using the deductive approach to\\nitem development wherein items are created using a theoretical\\nframework (hinkin, 1998). given that items should assess only\\none idea or construct (hinkin, 1998), we created three subscales\\nfor each of state boredom’s dimensions. the content of each\\nitem was intended to reflect the definition of its corresponding\\ndimension (see akremi, gond, swaen, de roeck, & igalens, 2015;\\nwalumbwa, avolio, gardner, wernsing, & peterson, 2008; for a\\nsimilar methodology). for example, our inattention items\\nreflected the definition: an inability to focus attention or diffi-\\nculty in maintaining attention. we ensured that the item word-\\ning was clear and succinct to facilitate respondents’\\ninterpretation of the items (clark & watson, 1995; hinkin,\\n1998). we supplemented these items with 19 items from the\\nmsbs disgement, low arousal, and inattention subscales,\\nwhich enabled us to test the extent to which the msbs items are\\nconsistent with our definition of state boredom.\\n\\nstudy 1: item reduction using item-sort tasks\\n\\nwe used two item-sort tasks to evaluate the items’ substantive\\nvalidity, which is defined as the extent to which an item’s\\ncontent reflects the focal construct (anderson & gerbing,\\n1991). item-sort tasks enable researchers to remove items\\nthat are not conceptually consistent with their construct defi-\\nnitions (anderson & gerbing, 1991; ferris, brown, berry, & lian,\\n2008; hinkin, 1998). the first sort-task (sample 1) sought to\\nconfirm that each item was consistent with its respective state\\nboredom dimension and the second sort-task (sample 2)\\nsought to ensure that each item did not reflect the content\\nof related constructs (hunt, sparkman, & wilcox, 1982).\\n\\nonce referred to as the “noonday demon”, state boredom has\\na history of being identified as a counterproductive force\\nwhose distracting qualities deter individuals from their work\\nduties (cassian, 2000; ponticus, 2006). state boredom’s close\\nhistoric connection to the shirking of formal duties points to a\\npotentially important role that feeling bored may play in the\\nday-to-day lives of employees. we suspect that our knowl\\nof state boredom and its explanatory potential in organiza-\\ntional research may be limited due to inconsistent definitions\\nand the absence of a scientifically sound measure. in our\\nresearch, we sought to address definitional and measurement\\nlimitations by presenting a consensus-based, theoretically\\nderived definition of state boredom and by developing a\\npsychometrically sound measure that is consistent with this\\ndefinition. we anticipate that a theoretically grounded defini-\\ntion and measure of state boredom will enable organizational\\nresearchers to better investigate how state boredom functions\\nat work.\\n\\nafter reviewing the boredom literature in search of com-\\nmonalities across definitions, we defined state boredom as a\\nlethargic, deactivated negative state (unpleasant low arousal)\\nin which one is unable to focus attention (inattention) and\\nexperiences a vague longing to ge in satisfying activity\\n(disgement). this definition is consistent with a higher-\\norder multidimensional structure, indicating that boredom\\n\\ncomprises three related but distinct factors (disgement,\\nunpleasant low arousal, and inattention) that collectively\\nrepresent state boredom.\\n\\nacross five studies using 10 independent samples, we\\nfound validation evidence for our scale. in study 1, we found\\nsupport for the content validity of the sbi, indicating that our\\nitems are conceptually consistent with each dimension defini-\\ntion. in study 2, we used irt to select the best-performing\\nitems, resulting in 11 items that effectively discriminate\\nbetween individuals at high and low levels of disgement,\\nunpleasant low arousal, and inattention. in study 3, we pro-\\nvided evidence for the sbi’s psychometric properties and sup-\\nport for its higher-order multidimensional factor structure. in\\nstudy 4, we found evidence for convnt and discriminant\\nvalidity, indicating that boredom is related to, but distinct\\nfrom, theoretically relevant constructs and is unrelated to\\ntheoretically irrelevant constructs. finally, in study 5, we pro-\\nvided evidence of convnt validity using a daily diary\\nstudy, demonstrating that day-level state boredom is related\\nto daily na, pa, and work gement. we also found overlap\\nbetween the sbi and other measures of boredom.\\n\\ncontributions\\n\\nthe present studies contribute to organizational research on\\nstate boredom in several ways. first, by building consensus\\ntowards a definition of state boredom, we ensure that\\nresearchers seeking to study it are theorizing about the same\\nconstruct. researchers who rely on different definitions make\\nit difficult for others to integrate theories on state boredom as\\nit is unclear whether they are theorizing about state boredom\\nor another construct. a shared understanding of state bore-\\ndom is essential for building a unified theory identifying\\ncauses and outcomes of feeling bored as well as mechanisms\\nexplaining why it predicts specific outcomes. second, organi-\\nzational research on state boredom has been impeded due to\\nthe absence of a proper measure. in our research, we provide\\nresearchers with a measure of state boredom that is opera-\\ntionally consistent with its construct definition and is\\ngrounded in theory. many early measures like the bps\\n(farmer & sundb 1986) and the ljbs (lee, 1986) are ill-\\nsuited for measuring boredom as a state as these measures\\nassess trait rather than state boredom and are context-specific.\\n\\nother measures used in organizational research are\\nsuboptimal as they suffer from construct deficiency and\\ncontamination (, guglielmi , 2013; van der heijden\\n, 2012). these scales omit content from the definition\\nof state boredom, failing to tap into its disgement,\\nunpleasant low arousal, and inattention dimensions.\\nmoreover, many scales confound the experience of feeling\\nbored with other constructs by incorporating items that\\noverlap with distinct constructs. this is problematic as\\nredundant content between measures of distinct con-\\nstructs can lead researchers to make unsubstantiated\\nclaims about how boredom functions at work. for\\ninstance, guglielmi  (2013) found that boredom was\\nrelated to work characteristics like learning opportunities;\\nhowever, given that their boredom scale reflected work\\ncharacteristics (, skill underutilization), concluding that\\n\\ntable 8. convnt validity correlations (sample 10).\\n\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\n\\n1. state boredom .91\\n2. negative affect .56 .95\\n3. positive affect −.45 −.42 .93\\n4. vigour −.74 −.24 .48 .93\\n5. dedication −.51 −.30 .62 .99 .93\\n6. absorption −.43 −.25 .50 .92 1.00 .90\\n7. trait boredom .64 .44 −.59 −.49 −.65 −.54 .85\\n8. work boredom .63 .41 −.40 −.30 −.45 −.47 .75 .94\\n\\nnote. the within-person reliabilities and cronbach’s alpha are presented for\\nwithin-person and between-person variables, respectively. boredom reliabil-\\nities are the average within-person reliabilities for the disgement, unplea-\\nsant low arousal, and inattention subscales. the correlation between\\nabsorption and dedication was rounded down to 1.00 as it was greater than\\n1. bolded correlations are statistically significant at p < .05.\\n\\neuropean journal of work and organizational psychology 489\\n\\n\\n\\nboredom was related to work characteristics is misleading.\\nwe anticipate that use of the sbi will enable researchers\\nto make more accurate conclusions about how feeling\\nbored relates to other organizational variables.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nalthough our research has strhs, there are limitations. we\\nrelied on self-reports to test our hypotheses, highlighting the\\npossibility of cmv (podsakoff , 2003). our decision to use\\nself-reports was based on the nature of our variables as many\\nwere subjective states (conway & lance, 2010). the central con-\\nstruct, state boredom, is an internal state that is unlikely to be\\naccurately estimated using other reports. in studies 4 and 5, many\\nof the other constructs also reflected internal states (, na) that\\nwould have been difficult to gauge using other-reports. moreover,\\ngiven that we expected the relations between state boredom and\\nother affective variables to be driven by overlap in momentary\\naffect, it did not make logical sense to temporally separate the\\nmeasurement of these constructs. when possible, we separated\\nthe measurement occasions between the sbi and dispositional\\nconstructs, which is thought to reduce cmv.\\n\\nanother limitation of this research is that although we\\nprovided evidence that feeling bored and its unpleasant low\\narousal dimension are distinct from other negative, low activa-\\ntion states like depression, apathy, and anhedonia, we did not\\nprovide evidence that it is distinct from a broader range of\\ndeactivating, unpleasant states, particularly fatigue. given that\\nboredom and fatigue are proximally located in the circumplex\\nmodel of affect (russell, 1980), future research may want to\\nexamine the extent to which the sbi is discriminant from\\nmeasures of fatigue.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nwe worked to advance organizational research on state bore-\\ndom by building consensus towards a theoretically grounded\\ndefinition and by developing an empirically validated measure\\nthat is operationally consistent with this definition. across five\\nstudies using 10 independent samples, we supported the\\nvalidation of the sbi. the results of these psychometric pur-\\nsuits revealed that a higher-order multidimensional structure\\nwith disgement, unpleasant low arousal, and inattention\\nfactors is an appropriate model of state boredom. we hope\\nthat the results of this research provide researchers with a\\ncommon ground for building a more accurate and compre-\\nhensive understanding of state boredom in the workplace.\\n\\nnotes\\n\\n1. due to space restrictions, we present the icc figures in the supple-\\nmental materials.\\n\\n2. the means and standard deviations for each sbi subscale (studies\\n2–5) are in the supplemental materials.\\n\\ndisclosure statement\\n\\nno potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\\n\\nfunding\\n\\nthis work was supported by the social sciences and humanities research\\ncouncil of canada.\\n'"

have positioned state boredom as an impediment to organizational productivity and performancven its unpleasant and distracting qualities. however research on state boredom has been impeded by lack of definitional consensus and measurement issues. in this article we sought to advance organizational research on state boredom by developing the state boredom inventory an -item measurounded in theoretically derived definition of state boredom. across five studies using independent samples we develop the sbi and provide validity evidence for our measure including content validity and convnt and discriminant validity. our data support the conceptualization of state boredom as higher-order multidimensional construct with three underlying dimensions disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention. article history received october accepted may keywords boredom multidimensional scale development scale validation diary study although sometimes viewed as symptom of modernity feeling bored has been studied as part of the human condition for centuries. our modern understanding of state boredom originates from theek word acedia which translates to without care and was used to describe idleness with respect to religious duties beginning in the fourth century.. acedia was considered to be one of vices and was closely tied to the avoidance of formal duties among catholic monks. nicknamed the noonday demon acedia was thought to strike around midday distracting monks from their work and tempting them to leave the monastery in search of stimulation. catholic monk john cassian described acedia as making monks either idle or restless. he writes to stay in his cell without any spiritual progress in as it were state of inactivity and surrender or drives him out from there and makes him in addition unstable and feckless. these early accounts suggest that little has changed with respect to how people experience boredom at work. if cassian description of acedia were updated with references to contemporary workplaces it might refer to cubicles instead of cells and rather than monk being unstable and feckless an employee might be distracting and ineffective. the link between boredom and counterproductivity has carried through to today with researchers recognizing that feeling bored may result in distraction at work. for example trait boredom or chronic propensity to feel bored relates to poor performance absenteeism turnover withdrawal and deviance. despite etymological and contemporary associations between feeling bored and employee effectiveness organizational research on state boredom is limited. this may be due to the fact that the organizational behaviour literature is wrought with divnt and sometimes contradictory definitions of feeling bored in addition to suboptimal scales. we sought to contribute to organizational research on state boredom by developing measure that is consistent with theoretically derived definition and that builds on the strhs of existing scales while addressing their limitations. in the sections discussed next we synthesize theories and definitions of state boredom with the aim of building consensus towards unifying definition. then we review how state boredom is typically measured outline the implications for testing organizational theory and explain why new scale is needed. finally using hinkin deductive approach to scale development we provide validation evidence for our measure across five studies using samples. defining state boredom the word boredom itself did not appear in the ish language until the mid-th century. dickens novel bleak house is often cited as the first printed use of the term. despite the fact that the word boredom has been around for over years and the concept has been around for centuries contemporary scholars have yet to agree on definition of feeling bored. in psychology existing definitions div from one another quite severely. for example it has been defined as low arousal and dissatisfaction subjective monotony and... frustration effortful maintenance of attention and contact patricia. baratta european journal of work and organizational psychology vol.  no.  informa uk limited trading as taylor francis group feeling unchalld and perceiving one activities as meaningless. these examples illustrate that there can be little overlap in the content of many definitions with some arguing for antithetical content. the absence of an accepted definition makes it difficult to build theory on how state boredom relates to organizational variables because researchers who define it differently are essentially theorizing about different constructs. given the disparate content of these definitions it is unlikely that researchers would expect each of these constructs to exhibit comparable associations with other variables. for example an employee who experiences meaninglessness and lack of chall may demonstrate very different pattern of behaviours than an employee who is frustrated. divnce in how boredom is defined limits researchers ability to build unified theory identifying causes and outcomes of feeling bored as well as mechanisms explaining why it predicts certain variables. to resolve these inconsistencies we conducted comprehensive review of the boredom literature to build consensus towards definition. our definition integrates the most commonly discussed and theoretically relevant components of state boredom. our review suggested that state boredom has been approached using multiple theoretical perspectives primarily psychodynamic arousal and attentional theories. we searched all peerreviewed articles through the end of that specified bored as key word. our search resulted in hits of which included definition of boredom. we coded each definition based on its themes or components and identified four major themes disgement negative or unpleasant state low arousal and inattention and six infrequent themes meaninglessness distorted time perception monotony attribution high arousal and feeling under-challd. in the next few sections we review each major theme and integrate them into definition of state boredom. state boredom and disgement psychodynamic theorists consider state boredom to be an unpleasant state resulting from an unfulfilled urge for psychic stimulation. they propose that boredom serves as defence mechanism that prevents individuals from acting on impulses. more specifically bored individuals are thought to have an intense need for psychic stimulation but cannot specify what they want because the urge has been unconsciously repressed. as result they experience dissatisfaction with their current situation and an aimless tension to ge in rewarding activity.  this uncertainty and vagueness about one own wishes is... characteristic of boredom. most contemporary definitions are consistent with these ideas as they describe boredom as feeling dissatisfied uninterested or withdrawn from the environment. more recently eastwood and colles defined state boredom as the aversive experience of wanting but being unable to ge in stimulating and satisfying activity. in line with psychodynamic theorists they further specified that in addition to wanting but being unable the bored individual is unaware of what it is that one desires. similarly mann and cadman suggested that bored individuals are unable to specify what to do stating that boredom stems from situation where none of the possible things that person can realistically do appeal to the person in question. taken together psychodynamic theory suggests that disengagement is key component of state boredom which we define as longing to ge in an unspecified satisfying activity. state boredom and unpleasant low arousal according to arousal theory state boredom occurs when our physiological arousal falls below an optimal level. decreased arousal is thought to result from under-stimulating environments leading to mismatch between one current and desired level of arousal. because individuals are motivated to maintain an optimal level of stimulation individuals who experience arousal below this level perceive it to be unpleasant. overall then arousal theory suggests that state boredom is an unpleasant low arousal state. in alignment with arousal theory organizational researchers stipulate that boredom occurs when the work context is under-stimulating. early organizational research on state boredom focused on routine factory jobs and vigilance tasks as feeling bored was thought to result from monotonous stimuli with under-arousing properties. most contemporary definitions of state boredom define it in relation to low physiological arousal involving feelings of weariness lethargy fatigue and drowsiness. for example hamilton referred to it as low arousal drowsy sort of boredom. few researchers contend that state boredom is accompanied by increased arousal and qualitative data show that bored individuals sometimes report feeling restless alongside lethargy. it seems logically and physiologically inconsistent to suggest that state boredom comprises both high and low arousal however arousal theory provides insight into why this occurs. arousal theory asserts that people are motivated to maintain an optimal level of arousal thus to maintain this level bored individuals who experience lethargic low arousal may make efforts to increase arousal either through changing their environment or by increasing their internal level of physiological arousal. reports of feeling restless when bored are associated with situations involving constraint and may be indicative of individuals trying to escape boredom through self-stimulation since changing the environment is not possible. we contend that whereas low arousal is an essential component of state boredom high arousal is likely result of attempting to escape it and is therefore an outcome of feeling bored. in addition to low arousal arousal theory states that boredom is experienced as unpleasant. this is consistent with circumplex models of affect in which affective states are positioned around circumplex along two orthogonal continuums valence and activation. these continuums result in circumplex divided into four quadrants activation pleasant activation unpleasant deactivation pleasant and deactivation unpleasant. state boredom is thought to inhabit the deactivation unpleasant quadrant. states that load similarly on the two continuums arouped in the same quadrant with boredom being plotted alongside drowsiness sluggishness and tiredness in the same deactivation unpleasant quadrant. this reaffirms the idea that unpleasant low arousal is critical component of boredom which we define as negative deactivated state that is manifested in emotions such as weariness and lethargy. state boredom and inattention attentional theories suggest that boredom occurs when sustaining attention is effortful. individuals feel bored when they cannot ge attention with external or internal stimuli required for participating in satisfying activity or when they need to exert conscious effort to maintain attention to increase task gement. evidence of the role of attention in boredom is found in cases of individuals with mild traumatic brain injury who suffered damage to brain areas implicated in attention. these individuals report feeling bored more frequently and have higher levels of trait boredom. other research has found that individuals high in trait boredom experience more attentional lapses and day-to-day attentional errors such as zoning out and misplacing keys. qualitative data show that bored individuals report inattention mindwandering anddaydreaming and tasks that require sustained attention like vigilance tasks are rated as boring. many contemporary definitions of state boredom include an attentional component in which the bored individual has difficulty concentrating and or maintaining attention. culp described it as lack of attentional interest and leary positioned it as an affective consequence of effortful maintenance of attention. overall attentional theories suggest that inattention is an integral component of state boredom which we define as an inability to focus attention or difficulty in maintaining attention. an integrated definition of state boredom together we define state boredom as lethargic deactivated negative state in which one is unable to focus attention and experiences longing to ge in an unspecified satisfying activity. this definition reflects the higher-order multidimensional structure of state boredom which comprises three components. multidimensional constructs have several distinct related dimensions that are treated as single higher-order theoretical concept. they are understood in terms of their dimensions and do not exist independently of them. we expect that state boredom is higher-order construct that manifests itself in experiences of disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention. in this structure the distinct but related dimensions of disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention are collectively referred to as state boredom. figure displays the expected factor structure. the measurement of state boredom in the current paper our goal was to measure the experience of feeling bored. some existing measures of boredom do not measure the discrete episodic construct of state boredom and instead focus on dispositional or environmental characteristics. the boredom proneness scale is used frequently but was designed to assess trait boredom or chronic predisposition to feeling bored. whereas trait boredom is dispositional and stable over time state boredom is momentary state that fluctuates in response to situations. although individuals high in trait boredom feel bored more often trait measures provide little insight into how bored one is at given moment or the affective experience of feeling bored. most other scales such as lee job boredom scale restrict the measurement of boredom to specific contexts and were not designed to measure how bored one is currently. the ljbs for example includes items like how well do you like the work that you do.  illustrating that these scales are better-suited for figure. higher-order multidimensional factor structure of state boredom. european journal of work and organizational psychology assessing overall perceptions of particular context and not how bored one is at given moment. organizational researchers have adapted existing measures to reflect state-like qualities but these measures suffer from construct contamination as they confound state boredom with antecedents like work characteristics and affective and behavioural consequences. for instance guglielmi measured boredom using items that reflect under-stimulating work characteristics like skill underutilization and low task variety. reijseger created the dutch boredom scale which captures affective cognitive and behavioural reactions to work boredom. for example one item tend to do other things during my work overlaps with counterproductive work behaviour potential outcome of feeling bored. the inclusion of these items is problematic when conducting research linking boredom to organizational variables as overlapping content between measures of conceptually distinct constructs can lead to inflated correlations. some measures are content deficient as they fail to capture all of boredom dimensions. reijseger defined boredom as state of low arousal and dissatisfaction but did not include items that directly measure this. instead one item during work time daydream was included to indirectly tap into unpleasant low arousal as they argued that daydreaming is manifestation of low arousal. similarly van hooff and van hooft measure of work boredom although useful for gauging perceptions of boring work does not include items that directly tap into the affective component of boredom. to date the multidimensional state boredom scale is the only validated multidimensional measure of state boredom. the msbs is -item measure that assesses state boredom along five dimensions disgement low arousal high arousal time perception and inattention. although the msbs is comprehensive it may be too broad as it incorporates high arousal and time perception as dimensions of boredom when they may be more theoretically consistent as outcomes moreover themsbs disgement and low arousal dimensions include content beyond their definitions. some of the disgement items describe potential causes of feeling bored such as constraint or routinization. routinework for example may lead some but not all individuals to feel bored for some it leads to creativity. similarly the low arousal items reflect sadness which is distinct from feelings of lethargy indicative of feeling bored. the sadness octant in the circumplex model is adjacent to the tiredness octant in which boredom is grouped highlighting that although these states are related they should be treated as distinct. we sought to address the limitations of existing scales by developing state boredom measure that is conceptually consistent with our theoretically derived definition. overview of studies we followed hinkin recommendations for scale development and present the results of these studies in three phases phase describes the item generation stage wherein we created large pool of boredom items and reduced them to an -item scale. phase tested the scale psychometric properties andphase provides convnt and discriminant validity evidence. phase item generation and reduction item generation wnerated pool of items using the deductive approach to item development wherein items are created using theoretical framework. given that items should assess only one idea or construct we created three subscales for each of state boredom dimensions. the content of each item was intended to reflect the definition of its corresponding dimension. for example our inattention items reflected the definition an inability to focus attention or difficulty in maintaining attention. we ensured that the item wording was clear and succinct to facilitate respondents interpretation of the items. we supplemented these items with items from the msbs disgement low arousal and inattention subscales which enabled us to test the extent to which the msbs items are consistent with our definition of state boredom. study item reduction using item-sort tasks we used two item-sort tasks to evaluate the items substantive validity which is defined as the extent to which an item content reflects the focal construct. item-sort tasks enable researchers to remove items that are not conceptually consistent with their construct definitions. the first sort-task sought to confirm that each item was consistent with its respective state boredom dimension and the second sort-task sought to ensure that each item did not reflect the content of related constructs. once referred to as the noonday demon state boredom has history of being identified as counterproductive force whose distracting qualities deter individuals from their work duties. state boredom close historic connection to the shirking of formal duties points to potentially important role that feeling bored may play in the day-to-day lives of employees. we suspect that our knowl of state boredom and its explanatory potential in organizational research may be limited due to inconsistent definitions and the absence of scientifically sound measure. in our research we sought to address definitional and measurement limitations by presenting consensus-based theoretically derived definition of state boredom and by developing psychometrically sound measure that is consistent with this definition. we anticipate that theoretically grounded definition and measure of state boredom will enable organizational researchers to better investigate how state boredom functions at work. after reviewing the boredom literature in search of commonalities across definitions we defined state boredom as lethargic deactivated negative state in which one is unable to focus attention and experiences vague longing to ge in satisfying activity. this definition is consistent with higherorder multidimensional structure indicating that boredom comprises three related but distinct factors that collectively represent state boredom. across five studies using independent samples we found validation evidence for our scale. in study we found support for the content validity of the sbi indicating that our items are conceptually consistent with each dimension definition. in study we used irt to select the best-performing items resulting in items that effectively discriminate between individuals at high and low levels of disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention. in study we provided evidence for the sbi psychometric properties and support for its higher-order multidimensional factor structure. in study we found evidence for convnt and discriminant validity indicating that boredom is related to but distinct from theoretically relevant constructs and is unrelated to theoretically irrelevant constructs. finally in study we provided evidence of convnt validity using daily diary study demonstrating that day-level state boredom is related to daily na pa and work gement. we also found overlap between the sbi and other measures of boredom. contributions the present studies contribute to organizational research on state boredom in several ways. first by building consensus towards definition of state boredom we ensure that researchers seeking to study it are theorizing about the same construct. researchers who rely on different definitions make it difficult for others to integrate theories on state boredom as it is unclear whether they are theorizing about state boredom or another construct. shared understanding of state boredom is essential for building unified theory identifying causes and outcomes of feeling bored as well as mechanisms explaining why it predicts specific outcomes. second organizational research on state boredom has been impeded due to the absence of proper measure. in our research we provide researchers with measure of state boredom that is operationally consistent with its construct definition and is grounded in theory. many early measures like the bps and the ljbs are illsuited for measuring boredom as state as these measures assess trait rather than state boredom and are context-specific. other measures used in organizational research are suboptimal as they suffer from construct deficiency and contamination. these scales omit content from the definition of state boredom failing to tap into its disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention dimensions. moreover many scales confound the experience of feeling bored with other constructs by incorporating items that overlap with distinct constructs. this is problematic as redundant content between measures of distinct constructs can lead researchers to make unsubstantiated claims about how boredom functions at work. for instance guglielmi found that boredom was related to work characteristics like learning opportunities however given that their boredom scale reflected work characteristics concluding that table. convnt validity correlations. . state boredom.. negative affect... positive affect. ... vigour. .... dedication. ..... absorption. ...... trait boredom.. . . . ... work boredom.. . . . ... note. the within-person reliabilities and cronbach alpha are presented for within-person and between-person variables respectively. boredom reliabilities are the average within-person reliabilities for the disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention subscales. the correlation between absorption and dedication was rounded down to. as it was greater than. bolded correlations are statistically significant at. european journal of work and organizational psychology boredom was related to work characteristics is misleading. we anticipate that use of the sbi will enable researchers to make more accurate conclusions about how feeling bored relates to other organizational variables. limitations although our research has strhs there are limitations. we relied on self-reports to test our hypotheses highlighting the possibility of cmv. our decision to use self-reports was based on the nature of our variables as many were subjective states. the central construct state boredom is an internal state that is unlikely to be accurately estimated using other reports. in studies and many of the other constructs also reflected internal states that would have been difficult to gauge using other-reports. moreover given that we expected the relations between state boredom and other affective variables to be driven by overlap in momentary affect it did not make logical sense to temporally separate the measurement of these constructs. when possible we separated the measurement occasions between the sbi and dispositional constructs which is thought to reduce cmv. another limitation of this research is that although we provided evidence that feeling bored and its unpleasant low arousal dimension are distinct from other negative low activation states like depression apathy and anhedonia we did not provide evidence that it is distinct from broader range of deactivating unpleasant states particularly fatigue. given that boredom and fatigue are proximally located in the circumplex model of affect future research may want to examine the extent to which the sbi is discriminant from measures of fatigue. conclusion we worked to advance organizational research on state boredom by building consensus towards theoretically grounded definition and by developing an empirically validated measure that is operationally consistent with this definition. across five studies using independent samples we supported the validation of the sbi. the results of these psychometric pursuits revealed that higher-order multidimensional structure with disgement unpleasant low arousal and inattention factors is an appropriate model of state boredom. we hope that the results of this research provide researchers with common ground for building more accurate and comprehensive understanding of state boredom in the workplace. notes. due
