(\\nkeywords:\\ninterpersonal emotion management\\nleader–member exchange\\nsocial exchange theory\\nemotion regulation\\nintroduction\\n\\nemotions are intricately intertwined in theories of leadership and lie at the core of many leadership mechanisms such as inspiring\\nfollowers, building and sustaining interpersonal relationships, and investing in follower outcomes such as satisfaction, performance and\\ncitizenship behaviors (, ashkanasy & humphrey, 2011; connelly, gaddis, & helton-fauth, 2002; gooty, connelly, griffith, & gupta,\\n2010; humphrey, 2008; humphrey, pollack, & hawver, 2008; rajah, song, & arvey, 2011). indeed, many scholars have acknowld\\nthat leaders are active managers of group emotion (ashkanasy & humphrey, 2011; brotheridge & lee, 2008; george, 2000; humphrey,\\n2008; humphrey , 2008; pescosolido, 2002; pirola-merlo, härtel, mann, & hirst, 2002).\\n\\ngiven the vast number of studies, debates and comprehensive reviews that have accumulated (, antonakis, ashkanasy, &\\ndasborough, 2009; ashkanasy, 2003; gooty , 2010; humphrey, 2008; rajah , 2011), the study of leadership and emotions is no\\nlonger considered an emng domain. many of these accumulated empirical studies have shed light on issues such as how leader's\\nownpositive andnegative emotional displays affect followers (i.e., brotheridge&lee, 2008), the impact of contagionprocesses that transmit\\nleader affect to the workgroup (, sy, côté, & saavedra, 2005), and the effects of leader surface and deep acting on follower outcomes to\\nname just a few (i.e., humphrey , 2008). the role of emotions in leadership literature, then, has primarily focused on leaders' emotional\\ndisplays, processes (, contagion, emotional labor) and emotion-related abilities (, emotional intelligence; positive and negative\\naffectivity) and the effects thereof on their followers, or groups of followers. what is less common in the literature is a focus on the active\\nor conscious behaviors enacted by leaders to manage follower emotions. such a focus would be consistent with the work of many scholars\\nwho have argued convincingly that followers and leaders alike consider the management of follower emotion, and negative emotion in\\nby elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n86 l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\nparticular, a fundamental leadership task (, ashkanasy, 2003; dasborough & ashkanasy, 2002; humphrey, 2008; huy, 2002; sanchez-\\nburks &huy, 2009; pescosolido, 2002; seo , 2012; toegel, kilduff, & anand, 2013). indeed, humphrey (2008) coined the term “leading\\nwith emotional labor” to reflect this critical function of a leader as an activemanager of follower emotion. yet, rather surprisingly, the liter-\\nature is fairly scant in this domain with very few studies focusing on specific behaviors leaders enact in response to follower emotion\\n(, gooty , 2010).\\n\\nto be sure, a handful of studies have examined leader behaviors as the cause of follower emotions. for example, dasborough\\n(2006) found that certain leader behaviors (, empowering followers, communication, demonstrating concern, recognizing\\nemployee effort) are the causes of affective events in followers thus leading to emotion experiences. similarly, mccoll-kennedy\\nand anderson (2002) found that followers experience more positive emotions when leaders display transformational behaviors.\\nin an earlier theoretical treatise, weierter (1997) argued that charismatic leaders reinforce follower self-esteem via displays of\\nenthusiasm and passion and thus nder positive emotions in followers. despite this progress, less is known about what specific\\nbehaviors leaders enact tomanage followers' negative emotions. and, importantly, what is the influence of these behaviors on impor-\\ntant job-related outcomes such as relationship quality, contextual performance and satisfaction?\\n\\nin this paper, we cast interpersonal emotion management (iem) strategies (williams, 2007) as observable leader behaviors\\ntargeted at managing followers' negative emotions. drawing upon increasing evidence in emotion regulation theories and empirical\\nfindings which suggest that people routinely manage and regulate others' emotions (, barden, zelko, duncan, & masters, 1980;\\ncovell & abramovitch, 1987; francis, 1997; huy, 2002; mccoy & masters, 1985; niven, holman, & totterdell, 2012; niven,\\ntotterdell, holman, & headley, 2012; pierce, 1995; rafaeli & sutton, 1990; richards, butler, & gross, 2003; toegel, anand, & kilduff,\\n2007; williams, 2007; williams & emich, 2014), we suggest that leaders regulate follower emotions via the use of leader iem strate-\\ngies. furthermore, drawing upon the tenets of social exchange theory and attribution theory we argue that followers attribute differ-\\ning intentionality to the use of these strategies, which in turn will influence relationship quality.\\n\\nspecifically, a leader's use of problem-focused strategies that mitigate or eliminate underlying causes of negative emotions will\\nrelate to positive follower perceptions of a quality exchange relationship between the follower and leader (i.e., lmx). in contrast, a\\nleader's use of iem strategies that are emotion-focused and leave the underlying cause of negative emotion unaddressed hinder\\nthe lmx relationship via decreased rapport and affiliation (, butler , 2003). we further expect that lmx will mediate the\\nrelationships between each of the iem strategies and routinely studied work outcomes: organizational citizenship behaviors\\nperformedwithin interpersonalwork relationships (ocbis) and job satisfaction.we chose these outcomes because of their conceptual\\nrelationships with lmx and their organizational importance, as both have been linked to organizational performance (, bolino,\\nturnley, & bloodgood, 2002; ostroff, 1992).\\n\\nour work contributes to the leadership and emotions literature in three unique ways. first, we extend research on emotions in\\nleadership by investigating perceptions of specific leader behavior targeted at managing followers' negative emotions. the lmx liter-\\nature has long contended that leader-follower interactions and role-making episodes can elicit high-quality lmx (, ballinger &\\nrockmann, 2010; liden, sparrowe, & wayne, 1997; liden & maslyn, 1998; sparrowe & liden, 1997; sin, nahrgang, & morgeson,\\n2009). yet, we know very little about the specific leader behaviors that are enacted during such role-making episodes or interactions\\nthat relate to lmx. an understanding of such behaviors could stimulate further theory and empirical research by pinpointing specific\\nleader behaviors (in addition to known lmx antecedents such as dyad tenure) that could foster higher quality lmx.\\n\\nsecond, we contribute to theory and findings in the study of social exchanges which have started to move away from a purely\\ntransactional-cognitive route to one that contends that emotion expression and regulation are key building blocks for the develop-\\nment and maintenance of interpersonal relationships (, ballinger & rockmann, 2010; butler , 2003; gooty, thomas, &\\nconnelly, 2015; harker & keltner, 2001; lawler & thye, 1999; saavedra & van dyne, 1999). considering that leaders' responsiveness\\nto followers' emotions in interpersonal relationships is laden with information, attributions and intentionality, a focus on such\\nemotional phenomena may be central to understanding social exchange (, butler , 2003; lawler, thye, & yoon, 2009).\\n\\nfinally, we contribute to the iem literature by offering a finer grained examination of iem strategies. this examination suggests\\nthat specific iem strategies differentially affect the quality of leader-follower relationships. understanding why perceptions of some\\niem strategies are likely to elicit positive outcomes whereas some are likely to elicit negative outcomes deepens our theoretical\\nunderstanding of iem strategies in organizations beyond current models, which suggest primarily positive effects for the target\\nindividual (williams & emich, 2014). in the following sections, we develop theory connecting the use of leader iem strategies to\\nevaluations of the social exchange relationships between leaders and their followers, ocbis, and job satisfaction. next, we present\\nempirical findings showing the importance of iem strategies in building or thwarting high-quality lmx. such lmx, in turn, mediates\\nthe association between leader iem strategies and work outcomes: ocbis and job satisfaction (see fig. 1 for a graphical description).\\n\\ninterpersonal emotion management strategies\\n\\ninterpersonal emotion management (iem) strategies derive from gross (1998) work on emotion management of the self and the\\nnotion that individuals manage others' emotions at work using the same tactics that they use tomanage their own emotions (francis,\\n1997; little, kluemper, nelson, & gooty, 2012; lively, 2000; niven, totterdell, & holman, 2009). williams (2007) outlined four\\ninterpersonal emotionmanagement strategies used tomanage others' emotions: situationmodification, cognitive change, attentional\\ndeployment, and modulating the emotional response.\\n\\nsituation modification consists of active efforts to directly modify or change a situation to alter its emotional impact (gross, 1998).\\nin situation modification, a leader will remove, modify, or change the aspects of the situation or problem causing an undesired\\nemotion in the follower. as such, situation modification is problem-focused. for example, if an employee is experiencing anxiety\\n\\n\\n\\n-.38**\\n\\n-.08\\n\\n.16\\n\\n-.11\\n\\n.22+\\n\\n-.32**\\n\\n.33*\\n\\n-.05\\n\\n-.06\\n\\n.41**\\n\\n.33**\\n\\n-.14\\n\\nsm\\n\\nlmx\\n\\nocbis\\n\\ncc\\n\\nad\\n\\nmer\\n\\n-.20*\\n\\njob

frame, a supervisor might modify the situation by reducing the amount of work\\nrequired for the task or by reassigning some of the employee's responsibilities to a coworker.\\n\\ncognitive change involves selecting which of many possible meanings will be attached to the situation, reappraising or\\nreinterpreting the situation as having less potential for harm to goals, concerns, andwell-being (gross, 1998). cognitive change entails\\nthe leader exhibiting behaviors that put situations in perspective for the follower, helping the follower see the situation in a more\\npositive light. thus, cognitive change is also problem-focused. for instance, if an employee were distressed that her r&d project\\ndid not receive funding, her manager might reframe the failure as a normal and important step toward developing a project that\\nwould get funding. cognitive change is distinguished from situation modification in that the antecedent causing the undesired\\nemotion is not removed or altered. instead, the negative emotional impact of the antecedent is mitigated by changing the way the\\nfollower thinks about the problem. when using this strategy, a leader is attempting to reduce emotion-provoking aspects of the\\nsituation in the mind of the follower.\\n\\nwe acknowl that when cognitive change is self-focused rather than interpersonally oriented, it is similar in content to the\\ncoping strategy known as positive reinterpretation (i.e., seeing a stressor in a more positive light and as a chall rather than a\\nthreat; carver, scheier, & weintraub, 1989). although positive reinterpretation has been cast as an emotion-focused coping strategy\\nby some scholars (, carver , 1989) and alternatively, as a problem-focused strategy by others (wright, mohr, sinclair, & yang,\\n2015; lazarus & folkman, 1984), we follow the latter as we contend that in order to reinterpret a problem in amore positive light for\\nothers, one must understand and focus on the problem.\\n\\nattentional deployment involves distracting attention away from the elements of a situation that are harmful to goals, concerns,\\nor well-being, or by moving away from the situation entirely (gross, 1998). in attentional deployment, a leader directs his or her\\nbehavior at distracting the follower in order to induce more positive emotions. leaders and other agents will often use humor\\n(, acting silly to make the target laugh) or other means (, denigrating a common enemy) as ways of distracting followers to\\nimprove their emotions (niven , 2009). attentional deployment is distinguished from situation modification and cognitive\\nchange in that the problem causing the undesired emotion is not removed, reframed, or directly addressed. instead, when using\\nthis strategy, a leader is attempting to distract a follower's attention from the cause of the negative emotion. in this way, attentional\\ndeployment is emotion-focused.\\n\\nmodulating the emotional response involves influencing emotional response tendencies. this strategy is aimed at reducing the\\nbehavioral expression of an emotion once it is experienced. in modulating the emotional response, leaders ge in behaviors\\nthat encourage followers to suppress their undesired negative emotions. suppression can be particularly important in organizations\\nbecause it can be easily communicated and modeled by leaders and also built into an organization's culture (hochschild, 1979; huy,\\n2002; mumby & putnam, 1992). indeed, organizational display rules are typically targeted at the suppression of negative emotions\\nsuch as anger, shame, and sadness (geddes & callister, 2007), and leaders encourage adherence to these display rules via acts of\\nmodulating the emotional response. for example, a leader may direct an employee to calm down when upset, or advise him or her\\nto “relax,” or tell him or her “that's enough.” leaders' attempts at managing followers' emotions often involve “making it clear\\n[one] do[es] not care how the target feels,” and aims to reduce the follower's expression of these feelings rather than to address the\\nproblem causing the feelings (niven , 2009, p. 504). thus, modulating the emotional response, like attentional deployment is\\nemotion-focused.\\n\\n\\n\\n88 l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\nimportantly, iem strategies are focused on the management of others' negative emotions. negative emotions arise out of a\\nperceived goal obstruction or threat in one's environment (see lazarus & folkman, 1984; ortony, clore, & collins, 1988). the iem\\nstrategies that we have described above differ in the extent to which they address the sources of followers' negative emotions. we\\ncontend that when iem strategies are visible and perceived by followers, not all iem strategies will create conditions that are optimal\\nfor relationship development and will have implications for leader-follower relationships.\\n\\nleader–member exchange and interpersonal emotion management\\n\\nleader–member exchange, with its roots in social exchange theory, suggests that leader-follower interactions lay the foundation\\nfor perceptions of the quality of the exchange relationship between leaders and followers (blau, 1964). followers' perceptions of lmx\\nreflect the expectation that voluntary actions on their part will be reciprocated by the leader (, bernerth, armenakis, feild, giles, &\\nwalker, 2007). these perceptions are important in the workplace because they influence performance-related and attitudinal\\nvariables (see dulebohn, bommer, liden, brouer, & ferris, 2012; and gerstner & day, 1997, for reviews). the history of followers'\\ninteractions with their leaders shapes their perceptions of the nature and quality of those relationships. such relationships develop\\nover a period of time (, bauer & green, 1996) and are based on role-making episodes (, sin , 2009). this history results\\nin leaders developing different types of relationships with their various followers (dansereau, graen, & haga, 1975; graen &\\ncashman, 1975). relationships with one's leader can reside anywhere on a continuum from a low-quality transactional relationship\\nbased on quid pro quo exchanges to a high-quality exchange relationship based on felt obligation and reciprocal behavior. graen and\\nuhl-bien (1995) note that higher quality exchanges are a function of met expectations resulting from such role-making episodes, and\\nthese expectations span both the task and interpersonal domains.\\n\\nthe social exchange view of lmx argues that the development and maintenance of positive lmx relationships occur via\\nhigh-quality interpersonal exchanges characterized by respect, liking, and mutual obligation (, dulebohn , 2012; graen &\\nuhl-bien, 1995). even though such interpersonal exchanges are ripe with emotions and emotion-related information, theory and\\nresearch in lmx have adopted a largely cognitive-transactional stance with a few notable exceptions (, ballinger & rockmann,\\n2010; saavedra & vandyne, 1999). furthermore, early works in lmx (, dienesch & liden, 1986) have underscored the importance\\nof member attributions and categorizations of leader behavior in forming lmx evaluations. considering that the experience, expres-\\nsion, and partner's responsiveness to emotions in interpersonal relationships is ladenwith information, attributions and intentionality,\\na focus on such emotion phenomena is key to understanding how such high quality lmx relationships could be fostered (, butler\\n, 2003). when leaders actively manage followers' emotions via iem strategies, such leader behaviors become an integral piece of\\ninformation that followers draw upon in further evaluating, reciprocating, and maintaining that relationship with their leaders.\\n\\nin this section,we propose that the use of leader iems that are problem-focusedwill be positively associatedwith lmxwhile, their\\nuse of emotion-focused iems will be negatively associated with lmx. for example, a leader might use situation modification by\\nassigning additional supportive resources (, coworkers, extra pay) to a subordinate who is feeling overwhelmed and anxious.\\nsuch a leader has clearly addressed the cause of the anxiety and attempted to alleviate it. thus, we contend that situationmodification\\nwill be positively related to lmx.\\n\\ncognitive change also addresses the cause of the negative emotion, but does so in a somewhat different manner. when using\\ncognitive change, the leader attempts to alter the follower's perception of the causes of the negative emotions (rather than altering\\nthe causes themselves). for instance, when a leader helps the follower see the cause of the negative emotion in a different light as\\nsomething that is temporary and will improve with each day, not only is the emotional impact of the situation reduced, but the\\nfollower is likely to appreciate the leader's attempt to reframe the situation. the leader has increased the follower's perceptions of\\nthe quality of their lmx and sense of obligation toward the leader. when followers then make positive attributions about the leader\\n(, “s/he cares aboutmygoals”), and they feel a sense of obligation based onmet expectations (i.e., “my leader just dealtwith threats\\ninmywork environment as i expected them to”), then a sense of obligation is created via the supportive leader behavior of reframing\\nthe workplace hassle.\\n\\nthere are at least three compelling pathways from follower perceptions of leader problem-focused iems use and lmx. first,\\nfollowers have role expectations regarding leader iem ( dasborough & ashkanasy, 2002; toegel , 2013). both positive and\\nnegative emotions stem from daily workplace events (dasborough, 2006; weiss & cropanzano, 1996). a key function of leadership\\nis to attend to or work toward alleviating workplace hassles (i.e., be problem-focused), thus mitigating follower negative emotions\\n(dasborough & ashkanasy, 2002; humphrey, 2008). when leaders use iem strategies that address the problems causing negative\\nemotions (situation modification or cognitive change), followers' expectations are met, a sense of obligation is created, and lmx is\\nenhanced.\\n\\na second pathway from leader iems to lmx is attributions of intentionality on the part of followers when they perceive leaders\\nusing problem-focused coping strategies (dasborough & ashkanasy, 2005). dasborough and ashkanasy (2005) state people act as\\n“naïve scientists” in deciphering, making sense of and attributing intentions to other people's behavior (see also martinko &\\ngardner, 1987 for a review of leader–member attribution processes). they further note that followers could attribute leader behavior\\nto a focus that is other-oriented or self-serving. we extend their logic further and suggest that followers attribute benevolent inten-\\ntionality to the leader (i.e., my leader cares aboutme and is watching out forme)when they perceive the use of problem-focused iem\\nstrategies. as noted earlier, this is due to the alleviation of work-related hassles that form the core of such leader iems.\\n\\nthird, when leaders use problem-focused iems, they communicate to followers that the expression of negative emotions is\\nacceptable. moreover, because emotions are rich with communicative information (alea & bluck, 2007), the expression of emotions\\ncan enhance communication, promote positive relational functioning (gottman & levenson, 2000; gross & john, 2003) and bring\\n\\n\\n\\n89l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\nneeded attention to important organizational issues (geddes & callister, 2007). using problem-focused iems, they not only address\\nthe source of the followers' emotion, but also may make followers feel validated and promote open communicate of followers'\\nthoughts aswell as emotions—which could set the stage for the relationship to be better (, gross & levenson, 1997). taken togeth-\\ner, each of these cognitivemechanisms— i.e., met role expectations of the leader, an attribution of benevolence and emotion rich com-\\nmunication in the relationship—all allow higher quality lmx relationships to em.\\n\\nhypothesis 1. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of situation modification will positively impact lmx.\\n\\nhypothesis 2. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of cognitive change will positively impact lmx.\\n\\nhowever, not all iem strategies used by leaders produce positive outcomes. when leaders use iem strategies that do not address\\nthe cause of negative emotions (i.e., are not problem-focused), followers' role expectations regarding the leader go unmet. their lmx\\nis undermined, and they are less likely both to invest in voluntary actions for that leader and to believe that their voluntary actions\\nmight be reciprocated.we argue that attentional deployment and themodulating the emotional response are likely to negatively im-\\npact lmx in the context of leader-follower relationships because they donot alleviate sources of negative emotion in the environment.\\nattentional deployment signals to followers that leaders are not willing to invest time and resources in altering the source of the\\nnegative emotion (materially or cognitively). thus, followers will be less likely to ge in reciprocal behavior. furthermore,\\nwhen followers observe that leaders do not attempt to address or alleviate workplace challs in their environment, one of\\nfollowers' fundamental role expectations of leaders is violated (graen & uhl-bien, 1995).\\n\\nthe awareness that those who should be able to address a workplace problem are instead trying to distract from that problem\\ncan cause resentment over time. for example, consider a follower who has had an intense negative experience with a customer\\n(or coworker) and feels angry. the leader might steer the conversation to focus on things that the follower enjoys. such responses\\nto follower emotions might distract the follower momentarily. however, because the causes in the follower's environment are not\\nmitigated or resolved, the follower might infer that the leader does not care enough to invest time and resources in alleviating the\\ncauses of his or her negative emotions. the follower will subsequently feel that his or her problem is being overlooked or ignored.\\nthis unmet expectation affects the follower's evaluation of the quality of the exchange relationship with the leader. furthermore,\\nthe follower could then attribute apathy and less benevolent intentionality to the leader as they have not observed behaviors directed\\nat alleviating the follower's workplace hassles. we hypothesize the following:\\n\\nhypothesis 3. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of attentional deployment will negatively relate to lmx.\\n\\nsimilarly, becausemodulating the emotional response (mer) involves suggesting that a target (i.e., follower) refrain fromexpressing\\nhis or her negative feelings, this mode of behavior shows disregard for those feelings and does not address the source of the negative\\nemotions. the use of mer not only conveys to followers that their emotions need to be suppressed, but also that the leader does not\\nacknowl their feelings as valid and is not going towork to alleviate them. in interpersonal relationships research, especially marital\\nsatisfaction research, a key cause for relationships to deteriorate is the suppression of emotion as they tend to be so rich with commu-\\nnicative information (alea & bluck, 2007). as an example, gottman and levenson (2000) in a 14-year longitudinal study of married\\nheterosexual couples found that emotions in interactions between the couple predicted divorce rates at a later timewith 93% accuracy.\\nour point here is that when leaders encourage follower to suppress their emotions, they lose the opportunity to address the problem,\\nmake followers feel validated, and to promote open communicate of followers' thoughts as well as emotions—behavior which could\\nhave set the stage for the relationship to be better (, gross & levenson, 1997). instead, the use of mer is likely to decrease interper-\\nsonal expressiveness and relationship quality (gross & john, 2003). indeed, as noted earlier, the suppression of emotion expression in\\nthat dyadic relationship can be toxic to the relationship as it hinders free and fair communication (, butler , 2003).\\n\\nwhether or not followers choose to suppress their emotions, leaders who ask their followers to refrain from expressing their\\nfeelings discount their followers' experiences. they also fail to resolve the emotion-eliciting event. followers may view leaders as\\napathetic regarding their situations (, dasborough & ashkanasy, 2002, 2005). thus, unmet role expectations for the leader, an\\nattribution of apathy rather than benevolence, and emotion-poor communication in the relationship—all may inhibit higher quality\\nlmx relationships from emng. we propose the following:\\n\\nhypothesis 4. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of modulating the emotional response will negatively relate to lmx.\\niem strategies, lmx, satisfaction and ocbis\\n\\noverall job satisfaction, which refers to the degree to which an employee enjoys a job, is not only a central job attitude and\\noutcome variable in organizational behavior (judge, thoresen, bono, & patton, 2001), but also a relevant outcome for lmx because\\nleaders directly influence subordinates' experiences of their jobs (dulebohn , 2012). organizational citizenship behaviors,\\nwhich refer to discretionary behaviors that promote effective functioning of the organization but are not typically recognized formally\\nby an organization (lee & allen, 2002; organ, 1988), are also relevant to the leader-subordinate context. high-quality lmx is\\nassociated with felt obligation (, “i owe him or her one”), and ocbs are a core mechanism for expressing both felt obligation\\nand the reciprocity that often accompanies high-quality lmx relationships (dulebohn , 2012).we focus specifically on interper-\\nsonal or altruistic organizational citizenship behaviors (ocbis) because these are directed at helping another individual and, therefore,\\nare particularly relevant for the exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates (williams & anderson, 1991).\\n\\n\\n\\n90 l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\ngiven this study's purpose of identifying importantwork outcomes associatedwith iem strategies, we position lmx as the explan-\\natory mechanism relating the perception of iem strategies to job satisfaction and ocbis. because the relationship between lmx and\\nsatisfaction and ocbis has been established in the extant literature (c.f. cropanzano & mitchell, 2005; dulebohn , 2012;\\nerdogan & enders, 2007; gerstner & day, 1997; liden & maslyn, 1998; ozer, 2008; wayne, shore, & liden, 1997), we will present\\ntheoretical support and hypotheses linking iem strategies to these outcomes indirectly via lmx.\\n\\nwe have proposed that, although all iem strategies may reduce negative emotions at least temporarily in specific contexts, only\\nsome strategies provide positive cues about leaders' willingness to address emotion-provoking threats to their followers' well-\\nbeing, whereas other strategies provide negative cues about leaders' willingness to do this. specifically, because followers' role expec-\\ntations regarding leaders' willingness to address threats to them are met via the problem-focused strategies of situationmodification\\nand cognitive change, these behaviors signal to followers that the leaders care about them.when followers perceive these behaviors,\\nthey are likely to experience a sense of obligation and higher quality lmx will ensue. this higher quality lmx as well as the sense of\\nindebtedness and obligation characteristic of high-quality lmx set the stage for extra effort to ge in extra-role behavior. having a\\nleader who acknowls and addresses obstacles in one's workplace via enactment of cognitive change and situation modification\\ncreates positive outcomes because (a) it provides a positive interpersonal cue as to the quality of the leader-follower relationship,\\n(b) it motivates followers to put in extra effort toward their tasks as they feel indebted to the supervisor, and (c) the resultant percep-\\ntion of higher quality lmx acts as a critical supportive resource for followers in that it enhances their belief that they can rely on their\\nleaders to overcome obstacles, thus encouraging ocbis.\\n\\nhigher quality lmx also facilitates job satisfaction for similar reasons. first, the supervisor and the work environment are both\\ncritical aspects of job satisfaction. when higher quality lmx relationships exist, job satisfaction should increase because followers\\nenjoy the material and relational benefits of that quality relationship (, dulebohn , 2012; erdogan & enders, 2007; ozer,\\n2008). finally, follower job satisfaction is also enhanced because high quality lmx signals to followers that their leader values their\\nrole and contribution and is willing to invest time and resources into that

related to ocbis through lmx.\\n\\nhypothesis 6. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of situation modification (6a) and cognitive change (6b) will be positively and\\nindirectly related to job satisfaction through lmx.\\n\\nin contrast to the effects of iem strategies that address the underlying causes of negative emotions, attentional deployment and\\nmodulating the emotional response are negatively related to lmx because (a) they do not address the underlying causes of followers'\\nnegative emotions and, thus, provide negative interpersonal cues about the quality of the leader-follower relationship, (b) they result\\nin unmet role expectations on the part of the follower, and (c) they leave in place obstacles or hassles in the work environment.\\n\\nhypothesis 7. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of attentional deployment (7a) andmodulating the emotional response (7b)will\\nbe negatively and indirectly related to ocbis through lmx.\\n\\nhypothesis 8. followers' perceptions of leaders' use of attentional deployment (8a) andmodulating the emotional response (8b)will\\nbe negatively and indirectly related to job satisfaction through lmx.\\nan important aspect of leadership is managing negative emotions in followers, yet researchers have just begun to investigate the\\nbehavioral strategies that leaders use to do so. further, even less is understood about the impact that perceptions of these strategies\\ncan have on leader-follower relationships or subsequent follower behavior and attitudes. the results of our study were consistent\\nwith a model in which followers' perceptions of lmx are influenced by their perceptions of the emotion management strategies\\nused by their leader. leaders' attempts to manage follower emotions can be positive as in the case of cognitive change and situation\\nmodification, negative as in the case of modulating the emotional response or neutral as in the case of attentional deployment.\\n\\nour findings are consistent with the premise that leaders' iem strategies provide interpersonal cues that can nder stronger\\npositive or negative perceptions about the nature and quality of the exchange relationships they share with their followers. perceived\\nefforts by leaders to attend to followers' needs and emotions, such as modifying the situation or reframing events, can provide such\\ntable 1\\nmeans, standard deviations, intercorrelations, and reliabilities.\\n\\nvariable m sd 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\\n\\n1 situation modification 5.14 1.18 (0.91)\\n2 cognitive change 4.75

met expectations—that are positively associated with lmx, ocbis and job\\nsatisfaction. across both of the problem-focused strategies, situation modification and cognitive change, leaders help followers\\nalleviate and minimizal-obstructive work events that serve as antecedents to undesired negative emotions. our findings suggest\\nthat such leader behaviors help foster follower perceptions that leaders care about their goal accomplishment and are positively\\nrelated to their evaluation of the quality of their relationships. indirectly, they relate to follower outcomes—both behavioral and\\nattitudinal. in addition, cognitive change was positively and directly associated with job satisfaction. because positive moods have\\nbeen found to be positively related to job satisfaction (judge , 2001; judge & ilies, 2004), the iem strategy of cognitive change\\nmay also influence job satisfaction by influencing followers' moods. to the degree that followers accurately perceive leaders general\\npropensity to use cognitive change, such that this perception reflects an increase in positive affect during emotion managing inter-\\nactions with the leader, the morneralized relationship that we found between this iem strategy and follower job satisfaction\\nmay be mediated by positive mood.\\n\\nconversely, across both of the non-problem-focused strategies modulating the emotional response and attentional deployment,\\nleaders fail to help followers alleviate and minimizal-obstructive work events that serve as antecedents to undesired negative\\nemotions. our findings are consistent with our contention that leaders who encourage followers to modulate, or suppress, their\\nemotional responses to negative events reap followers' negative views of the leader-follower relationship. telling followers “that's\\nenough” or to “cut it out” may signal that leaders have no interest in helping followers manage negative events; they just don't\\nwant followers to display negative reactions. this perception, in turn, is likely to relate to a less favorable evaluation of follower\\nlmx with the leader. moreover, the perceived demand for suppression may relate the desire to balance discretionary efforts against\\nthese additional demands for emotion work. when employees perceive that their leaders want them to suppress negative emotions,\\nthis lack of support can be compounded by the perceived demand for suppression. as a result of these perceived demands for suppres-\\nsion, the leader-follower exchange relationship suffers and ocbis suffer as well.\\n\\nit appears that modulating the emotional response may have an additional negative impact beyond that driven by lmx as it also\\nsignificantly and negatively related to both job satisfaction and ocbis. because the act of suppressing one's emotions may degrade\\none's relationships and well-being (gross & john, 2003; gross & levenson, 1997; pennebaker & beall, 1986)—a finding that has\\nbeen replicated in studies of the emotional labor (bhave & glomb, 2013; grandey & gabriel, 2015)—modulating the emotional\\nresponse may influence ocbis through other mechanisms. in terms of job satisfaction, it appears that the physiological stress of sup-\\npressing emotions relates to job satisfaction, and the perceived demand to do so may directly generate dissatisfaction (hochschild,\\n1983; brotheridge & grandey, 2002; grandey & gabriel, 2015). further, withholding discretionary behaviors such as ocbis is one\\nway that employees correct for unfair or extra job demands (organ, 1988, 1990).\\n\\nunexpectedly, we did not find a relationship between attentional deployment and leader–member exchange. we argued\\nthat when followers are adults who are aware that they are being distracted, they might deduce that the leader is uncaring or even\\nunderhanded regarding follower goals. our null result suggests that attentional deployment may operate through more complex\\nmechanisms. for instance, it may, at times, be perceived negatively as leader avoidance but at other times be viewed positively\\nas well-intentioned attempts to alleviate the employee's stress (even if the leader cannot address the environmental obstacle).\\nit could also indicate, however, that this iem strategy might not work as well in adult working populations as it does with children.\\nfuture research will need to investigate moderators that may help tease apart the possible positive and negative effects of leaders'\\nuse of attentional deployment.\\n\\nimplications for future research\\n\\nour study contributes to the leadership literature conceptually and empirically. conceptually, we developed a model of specific\\nand observable leader behaviors targeted at managing undesired negative emotions in the workplace. a vast body of literature\\n\\n\\n\\n94 l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\nexamines how leaders elicit positive emotions, but themanagement of undesired negative emotions is scarcely studied despite urgent\\nneed (gooty , 2010). empirically, our study provides initial evidence that leaders ge in discernible behaviors aimed at reduc-\\ning or preventing negative emotional responses to events at work. this is an important contribution to the current literature.\\n\\nthe nature of this study has allowed us to makneral statements about the potential predictive power of iem strategies and\\ntheir general use. again, consistent with research on emotion regulation of self and much of the research on emotional labor\\n(gross & levenson, 1993; brotheridge & grandey, 2002), the items used tomeasure leader iem strategies capturedwhether followers\\nperceive their leaders to be using these strategies in general. our study of iem strategies opens up a host of future research directions.\\nwemention several examples below. questions directly related to our results comprise our first three future directions. first, how do\\nthe frequency of use of each strategy and the relational contextmatter? from a follower's perspective, theremight be a point atwhich\\ncontinued use of a certain strategy would no longer affect relationship quality in the expected manner. event-based studies of iem\\nstrategies could shed light on the immediate impact of each strategy while considering the quality of the preexisting relationship\\nbetween leaders and followers, individual differences in personal emotional management styles, and other factors as moderators.\\nin addition, event-based studies may also reveal how preexisting affective ties influence perceptions of leaders' iem strategies and\\nmay even moderate their effectiveness.\\n\\nsecondly, does agreement matter? specifically, are there effects of the agreement between follower ratings of leaders' iem\\nstrategies and leaders' own ratings of the iem strategies that they claim to utilize? similarly, are there effects of the agreement\\nbetween leaders' iem strategies and the preferred self emotion-management strategy of followers? for example, the negative effect\\nof leaders' use of emotion modulation may be mitigated when a follower's preferred self emotion-management strategy is suppres-\\nsion. additionally, if leaders and followers hold systematically different perceptions of the leaders' iem strategies, this could have\\nimportant implications for both practice and theory. thirdly, are there moderators that change the effectiveness of iem strategies?\\nfor example, it is possible that the use of attentional deployment strategies could be positively related to lmx onlywhen the follower\\nis unaware that the leader is trying to distract him or her from the problem.\\n\\nwhile the primary focus of this study was the impact of leader iem strategies on followers, future research is needed to examine\\nthe potential personal consequences of these strategies for the leader (, niven , 2012). future research could investigate\\nwhether different iem strategies influence leaders' perceptions of lmx in the same directions that they influence followers' percep-\\ntions. for example, the same relationships may not hold for leader-rated lmx. similar to the expression of compassion (kanov ,\\n2004), iem strategiesmight be emotionally taxing on the leader and the resulting emotional exhaustion could be negatively related to\\noutcomes and perceptions of lmx. on the other hand, these strategies might generate positive emotions such as pride and increased\\nperceptions of lmx quality because the leader may perceive his or her own behavior as helpful and agentic. moreover, organizational\\nculture may moderate the effects of a leader's iem strategies. for example, leaders' iem strategies may generate more emotional\\nexhaustion in a competitive conflict culture than in a culture of love (gelfand, leslie, & keller, 2008; barsade & o'neill, 2014).\\n\\nfuture research should also investigate how leader iem strategies and lmx affect such relevant constructs as counterproductive\\nworkplace behaviors (cwb), absenteeism, turnover intentions, and job performance of the followers, as well as performance ratings\\nof the leader.\\n\\nbased on the current study,we canmake predictions concerning how these relationshipswill look, but future research can provide\\nsupport for our understanding of the impact of relationship quality on a wide variety of relevant variables.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nour research is not without limitations. one of our limitations is that datawere cross-sectional in nature. causality, thus, cannot be\\ninferred. we made theoretical arguments for the expected relationships and hypothesized directional association based on previous\\nresearch and our findings were consistent with these expectations. further, we strove to minimize method bias by including multi-\\nsource data collected at two points in time. consistent with work on emotion regulation of self and emotional labor, we investigated\\nthemanagement of undesirable, negative emotion; however, future research should also investigate situations inwhich leaders try to\\nmanage followers' emotions to be less positive andmore negative. for example, amanagermay try to instill fear of dismissal or guilt in\\nan employee so that he or she understands the importance of avoiding certain mistakes.\\n\\nthe use of the snowballing technique allowed us to gather matched dyadic data spanningmultiple organizations. yet, in its truest\\nform, this technique yields data that could violate many assumptions in probability statistics (cf. neuman, 2002). we acknowl\\nthis as a limitation of our study as well.\\n\\nimplications for practice\\n\\nthe findings of this study also hold several important implications for practice, should they be replicated. perhapsmost notably, it\\nis important for leaders to understand that their followers are aware of the efforts beingmade tomanage follower emotions. because\\nof the differential effects of the various iem strategies, leadersmust be aware that certain strategies are likely to bemore effective than\\nothers in ultimately improving satisfaction and increasing ocbis. managers in training could benefit from understanding the differ-\\nences between strategies that demonstrate understanding and personal caring versus strategies that demonstrate a lack of these qual-\\nities. in addition, leaders must understand that they cannot merely rely on the strategies they use to manage their own emotions to\\nregulate follower emotions. inmanaging one's own emotions, attentional deployment, or distracting oneself from the negative event,\\nmay prove useful. in contrast, distracting a follower fromanemotion-eliciting eventmay be ineffective in terms of follower-enhancing\\nperceptions of the quality of the relationship with the leader, ocbis, and satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n95l.m. little  / the leadership quarterly 27 (2016) 85–97\\nthe results of our study can serve as an additional layer of support for emphasizing social exchange as the basis for leader-follower\\nrelationships within the organization. instead of an exclusive focus on performance-based or task-based exchanges (, a promotion\\ngiven based on higher production outputs), leaders could be encouraged to help followers effectively resolve negative emotion-\\ninducing events at work. followers who perceive that leaders are “in tune” with their emotions may evaluate their relationships\\nwith their leadersmore favorably, performbetter, and exhibit higher levels of job satisfaction than those followerswithweak relation-\\nships with leaders. creating a perception that onnuinely is attempting to be helpful in managing emotions can be a powerful skill\\nfor leaders to obtain.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nleadership and emotions have taken a center stage in the management literature. yet, very little is known regarding the specific\\nbehavioral strategies used by leaders inmanaging follower negative emotions. drawing upon emotion regulation and social exchange\\ntheories, we contended and found results consistent with our argument that when followers perceive that problem-focused leader\\nemotion management meets expectations and creates future obligation, better lmx results. conversely, when followers perceive\\nthat leaders use the non-problem-focused strategy of emotionmodulating suppression, they reported lower lmx and job satisfaction,\\nand their leaders reported lower ocbis. our study suggests that the emotion management strategies impact the development of\\nhigher quality exchange relationships in the workplace and in follower ocbis.\\n\""

the study of leadership and emotions is no longer considered an emng domain. many of these accumulated empirical studies have shed light on issues such as how leader ownpositive andnegative emotional displays affect followers the impact of contagionprocesses that transmit leader affect to the workgroup and the effects of leader surface and deep acting on follower outcomes to name just few. the role of emotions in leadership literature then has primarily focused on leaders emotional displays processes and emotion-related abilities and the effects thereof on their followers or groups of followers. what is less common in the literature is focus on the active or conscious behaviors enacted by leaders to manage follower emotions. such focus would be consistent with the work of many scholars who have argued convincingly that followers and leaders alike consider the management of follower emotion and negative emotion in by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license. little the leadership quarterly particular fundamental leadership task. indeed humphrey coined the term leading with emotional labor to reflect this critical function of leader as an activemanager of follower emotion. yet rather surprisingly the literature is fairly scant in this domain with very few studies focusing on specific behaviors leaders enact in response to follower emotion. to be sure handful of studies have examined leader behaviors as the cause of follower emotions. for example dasborough found that certain leader behaviors are the causes of affective events in followers thus leading to emotion experiences. similarly mccoll-kennedy and anderson found that followers experience more positive emotions when leaders display transformational behaviors. in an earlier theoretical treatise weierter argued that charismatic leaders reinforce follower self-esteem via displays of enthusiasm and passion and thus nder positive emotions in followers. despite this progress less is known about what specific behaviors leaders enact tomanage followers negative emotions. and importantly what is the influence of these behaviors on important job-related outcomes such as relationship quality contextual performance and satisfaction. in this paper we cast interpersonal emotion management strategies as observable leader behaviors targeted at managing followers negative emotions. drawing upon increasing evidence in emotion regulation theories and empirical findings which suggest that people routinely manage and regulate others emotions we suggest that leaders regulate follower emotions via the use of leader iem strategies. furthermore drawing upon the tenets of social exchange theory and attribution theory we argue that followers attribute differing intentionality to the use of these strategies which in turn will influence relationship quality. specifically leader use of problem-focused strategies that mitigate or eliminate underlying causes of negative emotions will relate to positive follower perceptions of quality exchange relationship between the follower and leader. in contrast leader use of iem strategies that are emotion-focused and leave the underlying cause of negative emotion unaddressed hinder the lmx relationship via decreased rapport and affiliation. we further expect that lmx will mediate the relationships between each of the iem strategies and routinely studied work outcomes organizational citizenship behaviors performedwithin interpersonalwork relationships and job satisfaction we chose these outcomes because of their conceptual relationships with lmx and their organizational importance as both have been linked to organizational performance. our work contributes to the leadership and emotions literature in three unique ways. first we extend research on emotions in leadership by investigating perceptions of specific leader behavior targeted at managing followers negative emotions. the lmx literature has long contended that leader-follower interactions and role-making episodes can elicit high-quality lmx. yet we know very little about the specific leader behaviors that are enacted during such role-making episodes or interactions that relate to lmx. an understanding of such behaviors could stimulate further theory and empirical research by pinpointing specific leader behaviors that could foster higher quality lmx. second we contribute to theory and findings in the study of social exchanges which have started to move away from purely transactional-cognitive route to one that contends that emotion expression and regulation are key building blocks for the development and maintenance of interpersonal relationships. considering that leaders responsiveness to followers emotions in interpersonal relationships is laden with information attributions and intentionality focus on such emotional phenomena may be central to understanding social exchange. finally we contribute to the iem literature by offering finer grained examination of iem strategies. this examination suggests that specific iem strategies differentially affect the quality of leader-follower relationships. understanding why perceptions of some iem strategies are likely to elicit positive outcomes whereas some are likely to elicit negative outcomes deepens our theoretical understanding of iem strategies in organizations beyond current models which suggest primarily positive effects for the target individual. in the following sections we develop theory connecting the use of leader iem strategies to evaluations of the social exchange relationships between leaders and their followers ocbis and job satisfaction. next we present empirical findings showing the importance of iem strategies in building or thwarting high-quality lmx. such lmx in turn mediates the association between leader iem strategies and work outcomes ocbis and job satisfaction. interpersonal emotion management strategies interpersonal emotion management strategies derive from gross work on emotion management of the self and the notion that individuals manage others emotions at work using the same tactics that they use tomanage their own emotions. williams outlined four interpersonal emotionmanagement strategies used tomanage others emotions situationmodification cognitive change attentional deployment and modulating the emotional response. situation modification consists of active efforts to directly modify or change situation to alter its emotional impact. in situation modification leader will remove modify or change the aspects of the situation or problem causing an undesired emotion in the follower. as such situation modification is problem-focused. for example if an employee is experiencing anxiety - ZYX.. XYZZYX.. XYZ - ZYX. XYZZYX. XYZ ZYX. XYZsm lmx ocbis cc ad mer - job satisfaction fig.  path estimates additional paths tested in alternativemodel sm situationmodification ad attentional deployment cc cognitive change mer modulating the emotional response. lmx leader member social exchange b.  b.  b.. little the leadership quarterly over completing work within specified time frame supervisor might modify the situation by reducing the amount of work required for the task or by reassigning some of the employee responsibilities to coworker. cognitive change involves selecting which of many possible meanings will be attached to the situation reappraising or reinterpreting the situation as having less potential for harm to goals concerns andwell-being. cognitive change entails the leader exhibiting behaviors that put situations in perspective for the follower helping the follower see the situation in more positive light. thus cognitive change is also problem-focused. for instance if an employee were distressed that her d project did not receive funding her manager might reframe the failure as normal and important step toward developing project that would get funding. cognitive change is distinguished from situation modification in that the antecedent causing the undesired emotion is not removed or altered. instead the negative emotional impact of the antecedent is mitigated by changing the way the follower thinks about the problem. when using this strategy leader is attempting to reduce emotion-provoking aspects of the situation in the mind of the follower. we acknowl that when cognitive change is self-focused rather than interpersonally oriented it is similar in content to the coping strategy known as positive reinterpretation. although positive reinterpretation has been cast as an emotion-focused coping strategy by some scholars and alternatively as problem-focused strategy by others we follow the latter as we contend that in order to reinterpret problem in amore positive light for others one must understand and focus on the problem. attentional deployment involves distracting attention away from the elements of situation that are harmful to goals concerns or well-being or by moving away from the situation entirely. in attentional deployment leader directs his or her behavior at distracting the follower in order to induce more positive emotions. leaders and other agents will often use humor or other means as ways of distracting followers to improve their emotions. attentional deployment is distinguished from situation modification and cognitive change in that the problem causing the undesired emotion is not removed reframed or directly addressed. instead when using this strategy leader is attempting to distract follower attention from the cause of the negative emotion. in this way attentional deployment is emotion-focused. modulating the emotional response involves influencing emotional response tendencies. this strategy is aimed at reducing the behavioral expression of an emotion once it is experienced. in modulating the emotional response leaders ge in behaviors that encourage followers to suppress their undesired negative emotions. suppression can be particularly important in organizations because it can be easily communicated and modeled by leaders and also built into an organization culture. indeed organizational display rules are typically targeted at the suppression of negative emotions such as anger shame and sadness and leaders encourage adherence to these display rules via acts of modulating the emotional response. for example leader may direct an employee to calm down when upset or advise him or her to relax or tell him or her that enough.  leaders attempts at managing followers emotions often involve making it clear not care how the target feels and aims to reduce the follower expression of these feelings rather than to address the problem causing the feelings. thus modulating the emotional response like attentional deployment is emotion-focused.. little the leadership quarterly importantly iem strategies are focused on the management of others negative emotions. negative emotions arise out of perceived goal obstruction or threat in one environment. the iem strategies that we have described above differ in the extent to which they address the sources of followers negative emotions. we contend that when iem strategies are visible and perceived by followers not all iem strategies will create conditions that are optimal for relationship development and will have implications for leader-follower relationships. leader member exchange and interpersonal emotion management leader member exchange with its roots in social exchange theory suggests that leader-follower interactions lay the foundation for perceptions of the quality of the exchange relationship between leaders and followers. followers perceptions of lmx reflect the expectation that voluntary actions on their part will be reciprocated by the leader. these perceptions are important in the workplace because they influence performance-related and attitudinal variables. the history of followers interactions with their leaders shapes their perceptions of the nature and quality of those relationships. such relationships develop over period of time and are based on role-making episodes. this history results in leaders developing different types of relationships with their various followers. relationships with one leader can reside anywhere on continuum from low-quality transactional relationship based on quid pro quo exchanges to high-quality exchange relationship based on felt obligation and reciprocal behavior. graen and uhl-bien note that higher quality exchanges are function of met expectations resulting from such role-making episodes and these expectations span both the task and interpersonal domains. the social exchange view of lmx argues that the development and maintenance of positive lmx relationships occur via high-quality interpersonal exchanges characterized by respect liking and mutual obligation. even though such interpersonal exchanges are ripe with emotions and emotion-related information theory and research in lmx have adopted largely cognitive-transactional stance with few notable exceptions. furthermore early works in lmx have underscored the importance of member attributions and categorizations of leader behavior in forming lmx evaluations. considering that the experience expression and partner responsiveness to emotions in interpersonal relationships is ladenwith information attributions and intentionality focus on such emotion phenomena is key to understanding how such high quality lmx relationships could be fostered. when leaders actively manage followers emotions via iem strategies such leader behaviors become an integral piece of information that followers draw upon in further evaluating reciprocating and maintaining that relationship with their leaders. in this section we propose that the use of leader iems that are problem-focusedwill be positively associatedwith lmxwhile their use of emotion-focused iems will be negatively associated with lmx. for example leader might use situation modification by assigning additional supportive resources to subordinate who is feeling overwhelmed and anxious. such leader has clearly addressed the cause of the anxiety and attempted to alleviate it. thus we contend that situationmodification will be positively related to lmx. cognitive change also addresses the cause of the negative emotion but does so in somewhat different manner. when using cognitive change the leader attempts to alter the follower perception of the causes of the negative emotions. for instance when leader helps the follower see the cause of the negative emotion in different light as something that is temporary and will improve with each day not only is the emotional impact of the situation reduced but the follower is likely to appreciate the leader attempt to reframe the situation. the leader has increased the follower perceptions of the quality of their lmx and sense of obligation toward the leader. when followers then make positive attributions about the leader and they feel sense of obligation based onmet expectations then sense of obligation is created via the supportive leader behavior of reframing the workplace hassle. there are at least three compelling pathways from follower perceptions of leader problem-focused iems use and lmx. first followers have role expectations regarding leader iem. both positive and negative emotions stem from daily workplace events. key function of leadership is to attend to or work toward alleviating workplace hassles thus mitigating follower negative emotions. when leaders use iem strategies that address the problems causing negative emotions followers expectations are met sense of obligation is created and lmx is enhanced. second pathway from leader iems to lmx is attributions of intentionality on the part of followers when they perceive leaders using problem-focused coping strategies. dasborough and ashkanasy state people act as naïve scientists in deciphering making sense of and attributing intentions to other people behavior. they further note that followers could attribute leader behavior to focus that is other-oriented or self-serving. we extend their logic further and suggest that followers attribute benevolent intentionality to the leader when they perceive the use of problem-focused iem strategies. as noted earlier this is due to the alleviation of work-related hassles that form the core of such leader iems. third when leaders use problem-focused iems they communicate to followers that the expression of negative emotions is acceptable. moreover because emotions are rich with communicative information the expression of emotions can enhance communication promote positive relational functioning and bring. little the leadership quarterly needed attention to important organizational issues. using problem-focused iems they not only address the source of the followers emotion but also may make followers feel validated and promote open communicate of followers thoughts aswell as emotions which could set the stage for the relationship to be better. taken together each of these cognitivemechanisms.  met role expectations of the leader an attribution of benevolence and emotion rich communication in the relationship all allow higher quality lmx relationships to em. hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of situation modification will positively impact lmx. hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of cognitive change will positively impact lmx. however not all iem strategies used by leaders produce positive outcomes. when leaders use iem strategies that do not address the cause of negative emotions followers role expectations regarding the leader go unmet. their lmx is undermined and they are less likely both to invest in voluntary actions for that leader and to believe that their voluntary actions might be reciprocated we argue that attentional deployment and themodulating the emotional response are likely to negatively impact lmx in the context of leader-follower relationships because they donot alleviate sources of negative emotion in the environment. attentional deployment signals to followers that leaders are not willing to invest time and resources in altering the source of the negative emotion. thus followers will be less likely to ge in reciprocal behavior. furthermore when followers observe that leaders do not attempt to address or alleviate workplace challs in their environment one of followers fundamental role expectations of leaders is violated. the awareness that those who should be able to address workplace problem are instead trying to distract from that problem can cause resentment over time. for example consider follower who has had an intense negative experience with customer and feels angry. the leader might steer the conversation to focus on things that the follower enjoys. such responses to follower emotions might distract the follower momentarily. however because the causes in the follower environment are not mitigated or resolved the follower might infer that the leader does not care enough to invest time and resources in alleviating the causes of his or her negative emotions. the follower will subsequently feel that his or her problem is being overlooked or ignored. this unmet expectation affects the follower evaluation of the quality of the exchange relationship with the leader. furthermore the follower could then attribute apathy and less benevolent intentionality to the leader as they have not observed behaviors directed at alleviating the follower workplace hassles. we hypothesize the following hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of attentional deployment will negatively relate to lmx. similarly becausemodulating the emotional response involves suggesting that target refrain fromexpressing his or her negative feelings this mode of behavior shows disregard for those feelings and does not address the source of the negative emotions. the use of mer not only conveys to followers that their emotions need to be suppressed but also that the leader does not acknowl their feelings as valid and is not going towork to alleviate them. in interpersonal relationships research especially marital satisfaction research key cause for relationships to deteriorate is the suppression of emotion as they tend to be so rich with communicative information. as an example gottman and levenson in -year longitudinal study of married heterosexual couples found that emotions in interactions between the couple predicted divorce rates at later timewith accuracy. our point here is that when leaders encourage follower to suppress their emotions they lose the opportunity to address the problem make followers feel validated and to promote open communicate of followers thoughts as well as emotions behavior which could have set the stage for the relationship to be better. instead the use of mer is likely to decrease interpersonal expressiveness and relationship quality. indeed as noted earlier the suppression of emotion expression in that dyadic relationship can be toxic to the relationship as it hinders free and fair communication. whether or not followers choose to suppress their emotions leaders who ask their followers to refrain from expressing their feelings discount their followers experiences. they also fail to resolve the emotion-eliciting event. followers may view leaders as apathetic regarding their situations. thus unmet role expectations for the leader an attribution of apathy rather than benevolence and emotion-poor communication in the relationship all may inhibit higher quality lmx relationships from emng. we propose the following hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of modulating the emotional response will negatively relate to lmx. iem strategies lmx satisfaction and ocbis overall job satisfaction which refers to the degree to which an employee enjoys job is not only central job attitude and outcome variable in organizational behavior but also relevant outcome for lmx because leaders directly influence subordinates experiences of their jobs. organizational citizenship behaviors which refer to discretionary behaviors that promote effective functioning of the organization but are not typically recognized formally by an organization are also relevant to the leader-subordinate context. high-quality lmx is associated with felt obligation and ocbs are core mechanism for expressing both felt obligation and the reciprocity that often accompanies high-quality lmx relationships we focus specifically on interpersonal or altruistic organizational citizenship behaviors because these are directed at helping another individual and therefore are particularly relevant for the exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates.. little the leadership quarterly given this study purpose of identifying importantwork outcomes associatedwith iem strategies we position lmx as the explanatory mechanism relating the perception of iem strategies to job satisfaction and ocbis. because the relationship between lmx and satisfaction and ocbis has been established in the extant literature we will present theoretical support and hypotheses linking iem strategies to these outcomes indirectly via lmx. we have proposed that although all iem strategies may reduce negative emotions at least temporarily in specific contexts only some strategies provide positive cues about leaders willingness to address emotion-provoking threats to their followers wellbeing whereas other strategies provide negative cues about leaders willingness to do this. specifically because followers role expectations regarding leaders willingness to address threats to them are met via the problem-focused strategies of situationmodification and cognitive change these behaviors signal to followers that the leaders care about them when followers perceive these behaviors they are likely to experience sense of obligation and higher quality lmx will ensue. this higher quality lmx as well as the sense of indebtedness and obligation characteristic of high-quality lmx set the stage for extra effort to ge in extra-role behavior. having leader who acknowls and addresses obstacles in one workplace via enactment of cognitive change and situation modification creates positive outcomes because it provides positive interpersonal cue as to the quality of the leader-follower relationship it motivates followers to put in extra effort toward their tasks as they feel indebted to the supervisor and the resultant perception of higher quality lmx acts as critical supportive resource for followers in that it enhances their belief that they can rely on their leaders to overcome obstacles thus encouraging ocbis. higher quality lmx also facilitates job satisfaction for similar reasons. first the supervisor and the work environment are both critical aspects of job satisfaction. when higher quality lmx relationships exist job satisfaction should increase because followers enjoy the material and relational benefits of that quality relationship. finally follower job satisfaction is also enhanced because high quality lmx signals to followers that their leader values their role and contribution and is willing to invest time and resources into that relationship. thus we hypothesize the following hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of situation modification and cognitive change will be positively and indirectly related to ocbis through lmx. hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of situation modification and cognitive change will be positively and indirectly related to job satisfaction through lmx. in contrast to the effects of iem strategies that address the underlying causes of negative emotions attentional deployment and modulating the emotional response are negatively related to lmx because they do not address the underlying causes of followers negative emotions and thus provide negative interpersonal cues about the quality of the leader-follower relationship they result in unmet role expectations on the part of the follower and they leave in place obstacles or hassles in the work environment. hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of attentional deployment andmodulating the emotional response will be negatively and indirectly related to ocbis through lmx. hypothesis. followers perceptions of leaders use of attentional deployment andmodulating the emotional response will be negatively and indirectly related to job satisfaction through lmx. an important aspect of leadership is managing negative emotions in followers yet researchers have just begun to investigate the behavioral strategies that leaders use to do so. further even less is understood about the impact that perceptions of these strategies can have on leader-follower relationships or subsequent follower behavior and attitudes. the results of our study were consistent with model in which followers perceptions of lmx are influenced by their perceptions of the emotion management strategies used by their leader. leaders attempts to manage follower emotions can be positive as in the case of cognitive change and situation modification negative as in the case of modulating the emotional response or neutral as in the case of attentional deployment. our findings are consistent with the premise that leaders iem strategies provide interpersonal cues that can nder stronger positive or negative perceptions about the nature and quality of the exchange relationships they share with their followers. perceived efforts by leaders to attend to followers needs and emotions such as modifying the situation or reframing events can provide such table means standard deviations intercorrelations and reliabilities. variable sd situation

across both of the problem-focused strategies situation modification and cognitive change leaders help followers alleviate and minimizal-obstructive work events that serve as antecedents to undesired negative emotions. our findings suggest that such leader behaviors help foster follower perceptions that leaders care about their goal accomplishment and are positively related to their evaluation of the quality of their relationships. indirectly they relate to follower outcomes both behavioral and attitudinal. in addition cognitive change was positively and directly associated with job satisfaction. because positive moods have been found to be positively related to job satisfaction the iem strategy of cognitive change may also influence job satisfaction by influencing followers moods. to the degree that followers accurately perceive leaders general propensity to use cognitive change such that this perception reflects an increase in positive affect during emotion managing interactions with the leader the morneralized relationship that we found between this iem strategy and follower job satisfaction may be mediated by positive mood. conversely across both of the non-problem-focused strategies modulating the emotional response and attentional deployment leaders fail to help followers alleviate and minimizal-obstructive work events that serve as antecedents to undesired negative emotions. our findings are consistent with our contention that leaders who encourage followers to modulate or suppress their emotional responses to negative events reap followers negative views of the leader-follower relationship. telling followers that enough or to cut it out may signal that leaders have no interest in helping followers manage negative events they just don want followers to display negative reactions. this perception in turn is likely to relate to less favorable evaluation of follower lmx with the leader. moreover the perceived demand for suppression may relate the desire to balance discretionary efforts against these additional demands for emotion work. when employees perceive that their leaders want them to suppress negative emotions this lack of support can be compounded by the perceived demand for suppression. as result of these perceived demands for suppression the leader-follower exchange relationship suffers and ocbis suffer as well. it appears that modulating the emotional response may have an additional negative impact beyond that driven by lmx as it also significantly and negatively related to both job satisfaction and ocbis. because the act of suppressing one emotions may degrade one relationships and well-being finding that has been replicated in studies of the emotional labor modulating the emotional response may influence ocbis through other mechanisms. in terms of job satisfaction it appears that the physiological stress of suppressing emotions relates to job satisfaction and the perceived demand to do so may directly generate dissatisfaction. further withholding discretionary behaviors such as ocbis is one way that employees correct for unfair or extra job demands. unexpectedly we did not find relationship between attentional deployment and leader member exchange. we argued that when followers are adults who are aware that they are being distracted they might deduce that the leader is uncaring or even underhanded regarding follower goals. our null result suggests that attentional deployment may operate through more complex mechanisms. for instance it may at times be perceived negatively as leader avoidance but at other times be viewed positively as well-intentioned attempts to alleviate the employee stress. it could also indicate however that this iem strategy might not work as well in adult working populations as it does with children. future research will need to investigate moderators that may help tease apart the possible positive and negative effects of leaders use of attentional deployment. implications for future research our study contributes to the leadership literature conceptually and empirically. conceptually we developed model of specific and observable leader behaviors targeted at managing undesired negative emotions in the workplace. vast body of literature. little the leadership quarterly examines how leaders elicit positive emotions but themanagement of undesired negative emotions is scarcely studied despite urgent need. empirically our study provides initial evidence that leaders ge in discernible behaviors aimed at reducing or preventing negative emotional responses to events at work. this is an important contribution to the current literature. the nature of this study has allowed us to makneral statements about the potential predictive power of iem strategies and their general use. again consistent with research on emotion regulation of self and much of the research on emotional labor the items used tomeasure leader iem strategies capturedwhether followers perceive their leaders to be using these strategies in general. our study of iem strategies opens up host of future research directions. wemention several examples below. questions directly related to our results comprise our first three future directions. first how do the frequency of use of each strategy and the relational contextmatter. from follower perspective theremight be point atwhich continued use of certain strategy would no longer affect relationship quality in the expected manner. event-based studies of iem strategies could shed light on the immediate impact of each strategy while considering the quality of the preexisting relationship between leaders and followers individual differences in personal emotional management styles and other factors as moderators. in addition event-based studies may also reveal how preexisting affective ties influence perceptions of leaders iem strategies and may even moderate their effectiveness. secondly does agreement matter. specifically are there effects of the agreement between follower ratings of leaders iem strategies and leaders own ratings of the iem strategies that they claim to utilize. similarly are there effects of the agreement between leaders iem strategies and the preferred self emotion-management strategy of followers. for example the negative effect of leaders use of emotion modulation may be mitigated when follower preferred self emotion-management strategy is suppression. additionally if leaders and followers hold systematically different perceptions of the leaders iem strategies this could have important implications for both practice and theory. thirdly are there moderators that change the effectiveness of iem strategies. for example it is possible that the use of attentional deployment strategies could be positively related to lmx onlywhen the follower is unaware that the leader is trying to distract him or her from the problem. while the primary focus of this study was the impact of leader iem strategies on followers future research is needed to examine the potential personal consequences of these strategies for the leader. future research could investigate whether different iem strategies influence leaders perceptions of lmx in the same directions that they influence followers perceptions. for example the same relationships may not hold for leader-rated lmx. similar to the expression of compassion iem strategiesmight be emotionally taxing on the leader and the resulting emotional exhaustion could be negatively related to outcomes and perceptions of lmx. on the other hand these strategies might generate positive emotions such as pride and increased perceptions of lmx quality because the leader may perceive his or her own behavior as helpful and agentic. moreover organizational culture may moderate the effects of leader iem strategies. for example leaders iem strategies may generate more emotional exhaustion in competitive conflict culture than in culture of love. future research should also investigate how leader iem strategies and lmx affect such relevant constructs as counterproductive workplace behaviors absenteeism turnover intentions and job performance of the followers as well as performance ratings of the leader. based on the current study we canmake predictions concerning how these relationshipswill look but future research can provide support for our understanding of the impact of relationship quality on wide variety of relevant variables. limitations our research is not without limitations. one of our limitations is that datawere cross-sectional in nature. causality thus cannot be inferred. we made theoretical arguments for the expected relationships and hypothesized directional association based on previous research and our findings were consistent with these expectations. further we strove to minimize method bias by including multisource data collected at two points in time. consistent with work on emotion regulation of self and emotional labor we investigated themanagement of undesirable negative emotion however future research should also investigate situations inwhich leaders try to manage followers emotions to be less positive andmore negative. for example amanagermay try to instill fear of dismissal or guilt in an employee so that he or she understands the importance of avoiding certain mistakes. the use of the snowballing technique allowed us to gather matched dyadic data spanningmultiple organizations. yet in its truest form this technique yields data that could violate many assumptions in probability statistics. we acknowl this as limitation of our study as well. implications for practice the findings of this study also hold several important implications for practice should they be replicated. perhapsmost notably it is important for leaders to understand that their followers are aware of the efforts beingmade tomanage follower emotions. because of the differential effects of the various iem strategies leadersmust be aware that certain strategies are likely to bemore effective than others in ultimately improving satisfaction and increasing ocbis. managers in training could benefit from understanding the differences between strategies that demonstrate understanding and personal caring versus strategies that demonstrate lack of these qualities. in addition leaders must understand that they cannot merely rely on the strategies they use to manage their own emotions to regulate follower emotions. inmanaging one own emotions attentional deployment or distracting oneself from the negative event may prove useful. in contrast distracting follower fromanemotion-eliciting eventmay be ineffective in terms of follower-enhancing perceptions of the quality of the relationship with the leader ocbis and satisfaction.. little the leadership quarterly the results of our study can serve as an additional layer of support for emphasizing social exchange as the basis for leader-follower relationships within the organization. instead of an exclusive focus on performance-based or task-based exchanges leaders could be encouraged to help followers effectively resolve negative emotioninducing events at work. followers who perceive that leaders are in tune with their emotions may evaluate their relationships with their leadersmore favorably performbetter and exhibit higher levels of job satisfaction than those followerswithweak relationships with leaders. creating perception that onnuinely is attempting to be helpful in managing emotions can be powerful skill for leaders to obtain. conclusion leadership and emotions have taken center stage in the management literature. yet very little is known regarding the specific behavioral strategies used by leaders inmanaging follower negative emotions. drawing upon emotion regulation and social exchange theories we contended and found results consistent with our argument that when followers perceive that problem-focused leader emotion management meets expectations and creates future obligation better lmx results. conversely when followers perceive that leaders use the non-problem-focused strategy of emotionmodulating suppression they reported lower lmx and job satisfaction and their leaders reported lower ocbis. our study suggests that the emotion management strategies impact the development of higher quality exchange relationships in the workplace and in follower ocbis.
