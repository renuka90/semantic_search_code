investigates the configuration of cognition- and affect-based trust in man-\\nagers’ professional networks, examining how these two types of trust are associated\\nwith relational content and structure. results indicate that cognition-based trust is\\npositively associated with economic resource, task advice, and career guidance ties,\\nwhereas affect-based trust is positively associated with friendship and career guidance\\nties but negatively associated with economic resource ties. the extent of embeddedness\\nin a network through positive ties increases affect-based trust, whereas that through\\nnegative ties decreases cognition-based trust. these findings illuminate how trust\\narises in networks and inform network research that invokes trust to explain mana-\\ngerial outcomes.\\n\\na central insight of organizational research is\\nthat managers rely on networks of relations for\\nthe resources, information, and support needed\\nfor career and business success (coleman, 1988;\\nlin, 1999; seibert, kraimer, & liden, 2001). as\\nbusinesses evolve toward flatter structures and\\nmore fluid boundaries, the professional networks\\nthat managers develop become even more impor-\\ntant. trust, or the willingness to make oneself\\nvulnerable to another person despite uncertainty\\nregarding motives and prospective actions\\n(kramer, 1999; mayer, davis, & schoorman, 1995;\\nmcallister, 1995; rotter, 1967), is often impli-\\ncated when relationships in a network involve\\nthe exchange of valuable resources. trust can\\nfoster greater cooperation (, coleman, 1990;\\ndawes, 1980; messick & brewer, 1983) and richer\\ninformation exchange (uzzi, 1996) than would\\notherwise occur. these benefits of trust are fre-\\nquently invoked in network theorizing to account\\nfor network effects on important managerial out-\\ncomes such as job mobility (podolny & baron,\\n1997), job satisfaction (helliwell, 2005), and\\nknowl sharing (, abrams, cross, lesser, &\\nlevin, 2003).\\n\\ndespite the pivotal role of trust in network\\ntheorizing, there has been relatively little empir-\\nical research on what types of trust managers\\nplace in members of their professional networks\\nand where in those networks these types of trust\\nare most likely to occur. only a few studies have\\nexplicitly measured managers’ experienced trust\\nin their networks of professional relationships\\n\\n(, farh, tsui, xin, & ch 1998; ferrin,\\ndirks, & shah, 2006; levin & cross, 2004). fur-\\nthermore, although other areas of organizational\\nand social science research have distinguished\\namong the qualitatively different bases on which\\ntrust develops (kramer, 1999; lewicki & bunker,\\n1996; lewis & wrt, 1985; zucker, 1986), these\\ndistinctions have rarely been integrated into net-\\nwork research.\\n\\nin the present research, we begin to redress this\\ngap by applying the basic distinction between\\ntrust from the head versus trust from the heart—\\nthat is, cognition-based versus affect-based trust\\n(mcallister, 1995). specifically, we examine the\\nextent to which these two types of trust are asso-\\nciated with (1) the relational content of the ties\\nthat make up a professional network and (2) an\\nindividual’s embeddedness in positive and neg-\\native ties to the other members of a manager’s\\nnetwork. by examining how managers place trust\\nin others—from the head or the heart—we hope\\nto make several contributions. first, the distinc-\\ntion between cognition- and affect-based trust\\ncalls to attention two distinct systems of social\\npsychological processes. whereas cognition-\\nbased trust involves a calculative and instrumen-\\ntal assessment, affect-based trust involves empa-\\nthy, rapport, and self-disclosure. these processes\\nof trusting differ experientially and have distinct\\nantecedents and consequences (drolet & morris,\\n2000; kramer, 1999; mcallister, 1995). we

provide a service to research-\\ners who study specific types of networks (,\\nfriendship or task advice networks). different types\\nof network ties are akin to the different types of\\nnetworks that managers maintain. by elucidating\\nhow the two types of trust depend on the varying\\ncontent of network ties, we can gain a more nu-\\nanced understanding of exchange relationships in\\nprofessional networks. our research can therefore\\ninform network researchers as to when they can\\nassume the presence of what type of trust in the\\nspecific networks they study.\\n\\nthird, a more detailed understanding of trust in\\nsocial networks would enable researchers to build\\nmore precise theories. recent research has shown\\nthat cognition- and affect-based trust can lead to\\ndifferent outcomes (levin & cross, 2004; mcallis-\\nter, 1995; ng & chua, 2006). therefore, network\\nresearchers who make further distinctions between\\nthe types of trust, as opposed to treating it as a\\nunidimensional construct, could make more pre-\\ncise predictions.\\n\\ntheory development and hypotheses\\n\\ncognitive and affective bases of trust\\n\\nit is widely acknowld that trust arises through\\ndistinct psychological processes (kramer, 1999;\\nlewicki & bunker, 1996; lewis & wrt, 1985;\\nmcallister, 1995; zucker, 1986). a central distinc-\\ntion is that between cognition- versus affect-based\\ntrust (mcallister, 1995). cognition-based trust re-\\nfers to trust “from the head,” a judgment based on\\nevidence of another’s competence and reliability. it\\nis an instrumental inference that one makes from\\ninformation about the other’s behavior under spe-\\ncific circumstances. by contrast, affect-based trust\\nrefers to trust from the heart, a bond that arises from\\none’s own emotions and sense of the other’s feel-\\nings and motives. with affect-based trust, individ-\\nuals express care and concern for the welfare of\\ntheir partners and believe in the intrinsic virtue\\nof such relationships (rempel, holmes, & zanna,\\n1985). this type of trust usually involves emotional\\n\\ninvestment and is more enduring and generalizable\\nover situations than is cognition-based trust (lewicki\\n& bunker, 1996; lewis & wrt, 1985). these two\\ntypes of trust align with the broader distinction in\\nsocial psychology between two basic dimensions on\\nwhich people map others, competence and warmth\\n(fiske, cuddy, & glick, 2007).\\n\\nthe distinction between cognition- and affect-\\nbased trust has received considerable empirical\\nsupport (fryxell, dooley, & vryza, 2002; holste &\\nfields, 2005; levin & cross, 2004; lewicki & bunk-\\ner, 1996; mcallister, 1995; ng & chua, 2006; web-\\nber & klimoski, 2004; wilson, straus, & mcevily,\\n2006). in a field study of managers, mcallister\\n(1995) found that ratings of many trust-related\\nitems reduced to two factors rather than one in a\\nconfirmatory factor analysis. laboratory studies\\nhave yielded findings consistent with the mcallis-\\nter study (, ng & chua, 2006). moreover, the two\\ntypes of trust are differentially related both to con-\\nsequences, such as forms of organizational citizen-\\nship and cooperative behavior (mcallister, 1995;\\nng & chua, 2006), and to flows of tacit knowl\\n(levin & cross, 2004).\\n\\ndrawing on this evidence, we argue that it is im-\\nperative to differentiate these two types of trust in\\nnetwork research. that is, if particular networks are\\ntheorized to be helpful because they generate trust, it\\nis important to specify what type of trust it is and to\\nempirically test the assumed associations. we expect\\nthat trust is associated with particular network prop-\\nerties but that these associations vary depending on\\nthe type of trust. we focus on the two basic properties\\nidentified in egocentric network research: the tie\\ntypes or content of exchange within a relationship\\nand the structure of interconnection surrounding a\\nrelationship (i.e., embeddedness).\\n\\nwe focus on these variables because network\\nscholars agree that the two central concepts in net-\\nwork analysis are the structure of a network and the\\ncontent (substance) of the dyadic ties among social\\nparties (, burt, 1983; freeman, 2004; kilduff,\\ntsai, & hanke, 2006; schweizer, 1997; tichy, tush-\\nman, & fombrun, 1979). for instance, tichy \\n(1979) described the transactional content of net-\\nwork ties as elementary properties of social net-\\nworks. schweizer called the notion of embedded-\\nness “central to the social networks perspective”\\n(1997: 739). in their more recent review of the so-\\ncial network research paradigm, kilduff  de-\\nscribed the primacy of relations, or network ties, as\\n“the most regularly invoked difference between\\nnetwork research and conventional social science\\nresearch” (2006: 1034). they also described embed-\\ndedness as a key concept in network research.\\n\\nthe content of network ties and embeddedness\\n\\n1 we thank an anonymous reviewer for the observation\\nthat some network research treats trust networks as a\\ndistinct type of network. these previous attempts to mea-\\nsure trust in networks using a distinct namnerator\\nhave been methodologically limited to capturing only a\\nsingle type of trust. in our present research, we treat trust\\nas a psychological state that has different bases and could\\narise in different types of network ties.\\n\\n2008 437chua, ingram, and morris\\n\\n\\n\\nare also especially relevant to trust and the basis on\\nwhich it develops. in their professional lives, man-\\nagers maintain different types of network ties to\\nobtain different resources (, task advice or\\nfriendship support). some of these network ties are\\ninstrumental in nature, whereas others are more\\nsocio-emotional or expressive (lincoln & miller,\\n1979). this diversity of network ties lends itself\\nwell to the investigation of the different ways that\\nmanagers trust their network members. as for em-\\nbeddedness, the relevant literature identifies trust\\nas an important mechanism behind its influence\\n(, uzzi, 1996; uzzi & gillespie, 2002).\\n\\nin developing our hypotheses, we began by con-\\nsidering how managers’ trust depends on the\\ncontent of their ties to their network members. we\\nthen examined how trust depends on the network\\nmembers’ embeddedness in managers’ networks.\\nthroughout this study, we framed our hypotheses\\nin terms of how trust is associated with the network\\nvariables, although we acknowld the possibil-\\nity of a different causal direction. our goal was to\\nclarify the ways managers trust others in their net-\\nworks, not necessarily to pinpoint the causal ante-\\ncedents of trust. in particular, one key objective of\\nthis research was to identify where in networks\\ndifferent types of trust occur. we nevertheless con-\\nsider the issue of causal direction in more detail\\nbelow in our discussion section. also, for clarity of\\nexposition throughout this article, we adopt the\\nnetwork research convention of referring to a focal\\nindividual as “ego” and to his or her network mem-\\nbers as “alters.”\\n\\ntypes of trust and relational content\\n\\nwe first consider how an ego trusts alters con-\\nnected by four different types of social exchanges\\nin professional networks, namely (1) friendship\\nand social support, (2) task advice, (3) economic\\nand financial support, and (4) mentoring and career\\nguidance. we chose to examine these network ties\\nbecause they are common exchange relationships\\nin managers’ professional lives. various prior net-\\nwork research studies have also examined one\\nor more of these ties (gibbons, 2004; gibbons &\\nolk, 2003; ingram & roberts, 2000; larson, 1992;\\nmcgrath, vance, & grey, 2003; sparrowe & liden,\\n2005). we discuss each type of network tie sepa-\\nrately and analyze its unique effects on trust, al-\\nthough the tie types are by no means mutually\\nexclusive (, ties of friendship and task advice\\ncan run to the same alter). in fact, given that man-\\nagers’ network ties are often multiplex (i.e., multi-\\nple types of tie connect ego and alter), we hope to\\nunpack the content of these network ties and show\\n\\nhow different tie content is differentially associated\\nwith cognition- and affect-based trust.\\n\\nfriendship ties. as managers pursue their ca-\\nreers, they often forge friendship ties. friendship\\nbetween two individuals typically starts with inter-\\npersonal attraction (carley, 1991; verbrugge, 1977)\\nand grows with increased interaction. at the dy-\\nadic level, friendship enhances cooperation, en-\\ncourages resource sharing (krackhardt & stern,\\n1988), and facilitates open communication (jehn &\\nshah, 1997; sias & cahill, 1998). through friend-\\nship, individuals also find mutual care and con-\\ncern, social comfort, and enjoyment (bell & cole-\\nman, 1999; suttles, 1970). these patterns of\\ninterpersonal interaction have been in turn linked\\nto the development of emotional attachment (brass,\\n1992), intimacy (fehr, 2004; wiseman, 1986), and\\naltruistic behavior (suttles, 1970).\\n\\ngiven that friendship embodies socio-emotional\\ngements and positive perceptions of another’s\\nmotives, the presence of a friendship tie is espe-\\ncially likely to indicate affect-based trust. this is\\nbecause the elements of friendship are the founda-\\ntions upon which affect-based trust is built. friends\\nperceive each other as having their interests and\\nwelfare at heart (suttles, 1970). this expectation of\\ncaring altruistic behavior fosters affect-based trust\\n(mcallister, 1995; rempel , 1985). the domain-\\ngeneral scope of friendship also suggests a fit to\\naffect-based trust given that this type of trust gen-\\neralizes over circumstances (gibbons, 2004).\\n\\nalthough friendship in professional settings may\\nalso contain elements of cognition-based trust,\\nsuch as a prior history of positive interactions,\\nthese elements are not specific to friendship rela-\\ntions (gibbons, 2004). certainly, professional com-\\npetence and reliability are not necessary conditions\\nfor the development of friendship. hence, we do\\nnot hypothesize a relationship between friendship\\nties and cognition-based trust.\\n\\nhypothesis 1. in a professional network, the\\npresence of a friendship tie in which an ego\\ngets friendship from an alter is positively asso-\\nciated with ego’s affect-based trust in alter.\\n\\ntask advice ties. a key function of managers’\\nnetworks is to help them seek information and\\nadvice for problem solving (gibbons, 2004;\\nmcgrath , 2003; sparrowe & liden, 2005).\\ntask advice ties are channels through which man-\\nagers obtain resources such as information, assis-\\ntance, and guidance related to the completion of\\ntheir work (cross & sproull, 2004; sparrowe, liden,\\nwayne, & kraimer, 2001). in professional networks,\\nafter an alter has provided an ego with useful task-\\nrelated advice, ego is likely to identify this alter as\\n\\n438 juneacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nsomeone who has the relevant expertise, compe-\\ntence, or experience in thven task domain (thus\\ndemonstrating cognition-based trust). conversely,\\nan ego is also more likely to seek task advice from\\nan alter who is perceived to be reliable and compe-\\ntent because such an alter is more likely to provide\\nuseful assistance (borgatti & cross, 2003; hinds,\\ncarley, krackhardt, & wholey, 2000). for instance,\\nhinds  (2000) found that, when selecting work\\npartners, individuals preferred those who had rep-\\nutations for being competent. holste and fields\\n(2005) showed that cognition-based trust predicted\\nthe use of information and knowl from others.\\nhence, we expected the presence of a task advice\\ntie to be positively associated with cognition-based\\ntrust.\\n\\nhowever, alter’s being a source of task advice to\\nego does not mean that a socio-emotional relation-\\nship will necessarily develop between them. the\\nflow of task advice and information in a profes-\\nsional network can serve purely work purposes and\\nlack exchanges on the personal level. any social\\ninteractions between ego and alter are likely to be\\nconducted at arm’s lh until the two become\\nfriends (sias & cahill, 1998). therefore, we do not\\npredict any specific relationship between task ad-\\nvice ties and affect-based trust.\\n\\nhypothesis 2. in a professional network, the\\npresence of a task advice tie in which an ego\\ngets task advice from an alter is positively\\nassociated with ego’s cognition-based trust in\\nalter.\\n\\neconomic resource ties. managers sometimes\\nseek economic resources from others in their net-\\nworks, as a means to, for example, fund new\\nprojects or start business initiatives. economists\\nhave long acknowld that economic actions are\\ninfluenced by the degree to which the involved\\nparties trust each other (akerlof, 1982; williamson,\\n1993). this is because economic transactions carry\\nrisks and threats of exploitation. in economic trans-\\nactions, the presence of trust can reduce the spec-\\nification and monitoring of contracts, reduce un-\\ncertainty, and provide material incentives for\\ncooperation (hill, 1990). parties in an economic\\nexchange also have incentives to behave in a\\ntrustworthy manner if they expect to have future\\neconomic relations (axelrod, 1984). this type of\\ntrust is calculative and instrumental, and hence\\ncognition-based.\\n\\ncognition-based trust may further develop fol-\\nlowing positive economic transactions. for in-\\nstance, after an alter has provided financial re-\\nsources to help an ego achieve certain goals, ego is\\nlikely to view this alter as financially capable and\\n\\nas one whom he or she can rely on for such help in\\nthe future. as the economic interaction gets re-\\npeated, ego’s confidence in the competence and\\neconomic value of alter also increases (hite, 2005:\\n130). in sum, although the relationship between\\neconomic exchange and cognition-based trust is\\nlikely to be reciprocal and undoubtedly complex,\\ntheoretical and empirical evidence suggest that\\nthey are positively associated.\\n\\nhypothesis 3a. in a professional network, the\\npresence of an economic resource tie in which\\nan ego gets economic resources from an alter\\nis positively associated with ego’s cognition-\\nbased trust in alter.\\n\\nconversely, we expected economic resource ties\\nto have the opposite relationship with affect-based\\ntrust. instrumentality and affect in the same rela-\\ntionship may undermine each other, as reflected in\\nthe aphorism “never lend money to a friend.” in-\\ndeed, silver’s (1990) analysis of the modern west-\\nern conception of friendship suggests that the very\\npossibility of true affect depends on a separation\\nfrom instrumental concerns. although a precept of\\ncontemporary economic sociology is that affective\\nconcerns brace economic pursuits, they do not co-\\nexist effortlessly (zelizer, 2005). for instance, foa\\nand foa (1974) suggested that resources from dif-\\nferent relational domains (, money versus love)\\ntend to be incommensurable. this tension has been\\nrecognized in the network literature. in their study\\nof friendships between competing hotel managers,\\ningram and roberts (2000) found that managers\\nwere most likely to forge friendships when the in-\\nstrumental value of those relationships was high-\\nest. at the same time, the authors reported that\\n“while they [the hotel managers] had friends\\namong other hotel managers, these were not their\\nclosest friends. the instrumental component prob-\\nably limits them as vehicles for sentiment” (ingram\\n& roberts, 2000: 418).\\n\\nthe imposition of instrumentality on affect is\\nprobably greatest when economic resources are at\\nstake. unlike friendship and task advice, money is\\nfungible and easily quantifiable. it is therefore more\\nnaturally the subject of specific exchange—the ba-\\nsis of instrumental relations, rather than of thn-\\neralized exchange upon which affective relations\\nare built (bearman, 1997; flynn, 2005; sahlins,\\n1972). furthermore, to the extent that economic\\ndecisions often involve the maximization of self-\\ngain, economic exchanges may reflect what sahlins\\n(1972) called “negative reciprocity,” a type of reci-\\nprocity characterized by a high degree of self-inter-\\nest and lack of concern for the other. hence, man-\\nagers are not likely to develop deep, positive,\\n\\n2008 439chua, ingram, and morris\\n\\n\\n\\naffective relationships with those whom they en-\\ngage in economic exchanges, nor are they likely to\\nview those to whom they are affectively close as\\nsources of economic aid. this separation between\\ninstrumentality and affect should result in a nega-\\ntive association between economic-resource ties\\nand affect-based trust.\\n\\nhypothesis 3b. in a professional network, the\\npresence of an economic resource tie in which\\nan ego gets economic resources from an alter is\\nnegatively associated with ego’s affect-based\\ntrust in alter.\\n\\ncareer guidance ties. career guidance, such as\\nmentoring, is a complex form of social exchange\\nbecause it combines instrumental and socio-\\nemotional elements (clawson, 1980; kram, 1985).\\nkram (1985) described mentoring as a set of roles\\nand role functions that include coaching, support,\\nand sponsorship. these functions can be broadly\\ndivided into two categories, psychosocial mentor-\\ning and career enhancement mentoring. with psy-\\nchosocial mentoring, a mentor provides socio-\\nemotional support and encouragement. with\\ncareer enhancement mentoring, the mentor im-\\nparts intellectual skills and knowl and pro-\\nvides career opportunities and exposure for his or\\nher prot́. although traditionally older individu-\\nals provide mentoring, kram and isabella (1985)\\nfound that peers in an individual’s social network\\ncould also offer mentoring.\\n\\nin professional networks, when a given alter is a\\nprovider of useful career advice and opportunities\\nto a given ego, two types of perceptions are in-\\nvoked. first, ego is likely to perceive alter as having\\nrelevant experience, competence, and access to\\nvaluable information not available to him or her.\\nthis perception is the foundation of cognition-\\nbased trust. second, ego is also likely to perceive\\nalter as genuinely caring about him or her, because\\nalter is willing to provide career guidance and ad-\\nvice. furthermore, alters who provide ego with\\ncareer advice are also likely to provide socio-\\nemotional support, encouragement, and confirma-\\ntion in times of need (kram & isabella, 1985). as a\\nresult, ego develops affect-based trust in these al-\\nters. in sum, we argue that an ego is likely to have\\nincreased cognition- and affect-based trust in al-\\nters who provide him or her with career guidance\\ninformation.\\n\\nhypothesis 4. in a professional network, the\\npresence of a career guidance tie in which an\\nego gets career guidance from an alter is posi-\\ntively associated with ego’s cognition- and\\naffect-based trust in alter.\\n\\nhow do managers trust embedded\\nnetwork members?\\n\\nthe notion that trust in a dyadic relationship\\nmay be affected by the network structure that sur-\\nrounds it is at the heart of the concept of embed-\\ndedness (granovetter, 1985). various researchers\\nhave concluded that interpersonal trust increases\\nwhen a relationship is embedded in ties to third\\nparties (burt & knez, 1995, 1996; coleman, 1988;\\nferrin , 2006). however, these researchers\\nhave either inferred trust from the relationship be-\\ntween an ego and alter (burt & knez, 1995) or relied\\non a unidimensional measure of trust (ferrin ,\\n2006).\\n\\nwe extend this line of research on embeddedness\\nin two ways. first, we differentiate between cogni-\\ntion- and affect-based trust. second, we further dis-\\ntinguish between positive embeddedness and neg-\\native embeddedness. by positive embeddedness,\\nwe refer to the extent to which an alter is connected\\nto other alters by positive ties. these positive ties\\nneed not be affectively charged and can vary in\\nstrh. examples range from friendship to coop-\\nerative formal working relationships. by negative\\nembeddedness, we refer to the extent to which an\\nalter is connected to other alters by negative ties.\\nfor example, two alters might dislike each other\\nand intentionally avoid or even attempt to harm\\neach other. although negative relationships are rel-\\natively uncommon in networks, their rarity makes\\nthem especially salient (labianca, brass, & gray,\\n1998). indeed, social psychological research has\\nshown that negative information is given heavier\\nwt and consideration than positive or neutral\\ninformation because it represents potential threats\\nor dangers (rozin & royzman, 2001; taylor, 1991).\\nnegative relationships are important to consider\\nbecause they represent the liability side of the so-\\ncial lr and can affect organizational effective-\\nness (jehn, 1995; labianca & brass, 2006). let us\\nconsider each form of embeddedness in turn.\\n\\npositive embeddedness. we propose that an al-\\nter’s positive embeddedness is positively associ-\\nated with an ego’s affect-based trust in him or her.\\nrecall that cognition-based trust is more instru-\\nmental and calculative, whereas affect-based trust\\nis more socio-emotional. dense networks have been\\nshown to provide social support (house, umber-\\nson, & landis, 1988; kadushin, 1982; mitchell &\\ntrickett, 1980; polister, 1980; stokes, 1985; stokes\\n& levin, 1986) and increase affect (totterdell, wall,\\nholman, diamond, & epitropaki, 2004). these are\\nconditions conducive to the development of affect-\\nbased trust. in addition, the more connected an\\nalter is by positive ties to other alters in an ego’s\\n\\n440 juneacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nnetwork, theater is the level of perceived soli-\\ndarity, the perception that alter is an integral part of\\nego’s in-group (kadushin, 1982; wellman, 1988).\\nwith high positive embeddedness, the force of\\ngroup identity and cohesiveness strhens the\\nsocio-emotional bond with alter (fiske & neub\\n1990). thus, ego should have higher affect-based\\ntrust in a densely embedded alter because such an\\nalter is more likely to be perceived as having ego’s\\nwelfare and interests at heart.\\n\\nis positive embeddedness also associated with\\ncognition-based trust? to be sure, embeddedness\\ncan provide better monitoring of an alter’s behav-\\niors, thereby increasing alter’s reliability. positive\\nfeedback from other alters might also increase an\\nego’s favorable perceptions of an alter. however, in\\nthe presence of a direct tie between ego and alter,\\nego’s view of alter’s reliability and competence\\nshould be primarily associated with alter’s mani-\\nfest skills and track record, as opposed to second-\\nhand information or third-party monitoring. in\\nother words, the degree to which alter is highly\\nconnected to ego’s other network members by pos-\\nitive ties may not greatly affect alter’s professional\\ncompetence and reliability. hence, although we\\npredict that ego is likely to have affect-based trust\\nin highly embedded alters, we do not make specific\\npredictions regarding the relationship between\\npositive embeddedness and cognition-based trust.\\n\\nhypothesis 5. the more embedded an alter is\\nin an ego’s network by positive ties, the higher\\nego’s affect-based trust in alter.\\n\\nnegative embeddedness. we propose that when\\na given alter is connected to other alters in an ego’s\\nnetwork by negative ties (i.e., negative embedded-\\nness exists), ego’s trust in alter is undermined. this\\nprediction is derived from balance theory (heider,\\n1958, 1979), according to which relationships be-\\ntween the pairs in a triad are congruent. in other\\nwords, if a has positive relationships with b and c,\\nb and c should have a positive relationship with\\neach other. if b and c have a negative relationship,\\na will have to reconsider his or her positive tie\\nwith one of them. thus, the more a focal alter is\\nconnected by negative ties to other alters, the more\\ndifficult it becomes for ego to maintain a positive\\nrelationship with this focal alter (since other alters\\ndislike him or her). as a result, ego’s trust percep-\\ntions of the focal alter should be lower.\\n\\nthe negative association between negative em-\\nbeddedness and trust is likely to apply to both\\ncognition- and affect-based trust. negative ties\\namong alters can increase perceptions of intragroup\\nconflict (labianca , 1998) and decrease per-\\nceived group solidarity and cohesiveness, thereby\\n\\nreducing affect-based trust. negative ties among al-\\nters can also lower ego’s cognition-based trust in a\\nfocal alter because negative feedback or gossip ob-\\ntained from other alters could undermine ego’s oth-\\nerwise positive perceptions of his or her reliability\\nand competence. it is useful to note the asymmetric\\neffect of third-party feedback. positive information\\nfrom third parties may not greatly influence ego’s\\ncognition-based trust in alter, but it is likely that\\nnegative information will. this is because negative\\ninformation signals potential problems in future\\ninteractions with alter and thus stands out and\\nws more heavily in ego’s trust evaluations.2\\n\\nmoreover, negative information is also dispropor-\\ntionately likely to be passed along to ego as it not\\nonly better serves the function of social vigilance\\nbut also makes for titillating gossip (dunbar, 2004;\\nwert & solavey, 2004).\\n\\nhypothesis 6. the more embedded an alter is\\nin an ego’s network by negative ties, the lower\\nego’s cognition- and affect-based trust in alter.\\n\\nalthough trust plays a central role in network\\ntheorizing, its constituent elements have seldom\\nbeen directly examined in network research. to\\nbridge this gap, we examined patterns of trust in\\nprofessional networks. we found that not only do\\nmanagers trust network members differently de-\\npending on the content of network ties, but also\\nthat differences exist in how each type of trust is\\nassociated with different forms of embeddedness.\\nspecifically, managers have more affect-based trust\\nin network members who are friends, sources of\\ncareer guidance, or densely embedded in their net-\\n\\n2008 445chua, ingram, and morris\\n\\n\\n\\nworks by positive ties. when a network member is\\na source of economic assistance, managers’ affect-\\nbased trust in him or her actually decreases.\\ncognition-based trust, on the other hand, is higher\\nin those who provide task advice, economic assis-\\ntance, or career guidance. whereas positive embed-\\ndedness has no effect on cognition-based trust, neg-\\native embeddedness reduces this type of trust.\\n\\ntheoretical implications\\n\\nour study has several theoretical implications for\\nnetwork research. first, we offer a more nuanced\\nview regarding the existence of the different types\\n\\nof trust in social networks. in light of our findings,\\nit appears that the common assumption that trust\\nexists in networks ties that involve the exchange of\\nvaluable resources provides only part of the story.\\nsometimes network ties can be negatively associ-\\nated with a type of trust. our findings suggest, for\\ninstance, that when a is connected to b by an\\neconomic resource tie, the level of cognition-based\\ntrust between a and b is higher than it might be\\notherwise, but the level of affect-based trust is\\nlower. thus, network researchers studying eco-\\nnomic exchange networks should be particularly\\ncareful when they invoke trust as part of their\\narguments.\\n\\ntable 2\\nresults of random-effects regression analyses on affect- and cognition-based trusta\\n\\nvariables\\n\\naffect-based trust cognition-based trust\\n\\nmodel 1 model 2

so far been underplayed in the\\nmany applications of network theories to economic\\nand organizational contexts. that is, economic re-\\nlations undermine affect-based trust. this is not to\\nsay affect-based trust never exists in those relation-\\nships; clearly it does. rather, our results suggest the\\nopportunity for a shift in the theoretical attention of\\nnetwork theorists, from the implications of affect in\\neconomic contexts to the phenomenon of the very\\nexistence of such trust. the results here join efforts\\nsuch as those of silver (1990) and zelizer (2005) in\\nsuggesting that the commingling of affect and eco-\\nnomic exchange is not a “natural” occurrence, even\\nif it is a common one. the question of how affect\\nand instrumentality may coexist provides a rich\\nopportunity to advance theories at the nexus of\\neconomy and society.\\n\\nour findings also highlight a difference between\\ntask advice and career guidance ties. whereas task\\nadvice ties are positively associated with only\\ncognition-based trust, career guidance ties are\\npositively associated with both cognition- and\\naffect-based trust. therefore, it is important for re-\\nsearchers studying advice networks to clearly spec-\\nify the type of advice in which they are interested.\\nalthough the provision of advice is generally asso-\\nciated with increased trust, how managers trust\\nthose who provide them with advice depends on its\\nspecific content.\\n\\nthe result that cognition- and affect-based trust\\nare differentially associated with forms of embed-\\ndedness is also of notable theoretical importance.\\nin the social network literature, the most prominent\\nargument regarding the benefits of a dense network\\nis that it provides social closure, which in turn\\nincreases trust among network actors (, burt &\\nknez, 1995; coleman, 1988). although wner-\\nally agree with this assertion, our study suggests\\nthat the trust that is associated with a dense net-\\nwork composed by positive ties is socio-emotional\\nin nature. in other words, actors believe that their\\ndensely embedded network members are trustwor-\\nthy in that they belong to a closely knit group and\\nthus have each other’s interests and welfare at\\nheart. actors do not necessarily perceive their\\ndensely embedded network members as being more\\ncompetent or reliable. this distinction is important\\nwhen researchers invoke the argument that a dense\\nnetwork nders trust. the validity of this argu-\\nment depends on the type of trust and the associ-\\nated outcomes of interest.\\n\\nin addition, we extended prior research on em-\\nbeddedness and trust by examining the effects of\\n\\nnegative embeddedness. we hypothesized that neg-\\native embeddedness would reduce both types of\\ntrust but only found evidence that negative embed-\\ndedness reduces cognition-based trust. one expla-\\nnation could be that positive and negative embed-\\ndedness exert opposite influences on affect-based\\ntrust but that positive embeddedness is much more\\nprevalent and hence has a stronger effect. indeed,\\nonly 14 percent of listed alters had some level of\\nnegative embeddedness, whereas 92 percent had\\nsome level of positive embeddedness. conversely,\\nbecause positive embeddedness is unlikely to in-\\nfluence cognition-based trust, the relationship be-\\ntween negative embeddedness and this type of trust\\nbecomes more pronounced.\\n\\nfinally, our results can be used to interpret find-\\nings from prior research. consider, for example, the\\nstudy on sydney hotels by ingram and roberts\\n(2000). those researchers examined the friendship\\nnetworks of hotel managers and found evidence of\\ncollusion and customer sharing, two behavioral\\noutcomes that depend on social cohesion and care\\nand concern for each other. this finding is consis-\\ntent with our finding that friendship ties are posi-\\ntively associated with affect-based trust. yet among\\nthese hotel managers who were friends, there was\\nnot much evidence of knowl sharing, a be-\\nhavior that depends more on cognition-based\\ntrust, which is not a primary element in friend-\\nship networks.\\n\\npractical implications\\n\\nrecent research shows that trust in the work-\\nplace is an extremely valuable resource with a sig-\\nnificant effect on job satisfaction and well-being\\n(helliwell, 2005). the negotiation literature also\\nsuggests that people are more willing to cooperate\\nwith those whom they trust (, drolet & morris,\\n2000). hence, knowl that can guide managers\\nin developing trust in the workplace and in detect-\\ning trusting relationships among coworkers is likely\\nto bring substantive benefits.\\n\\nour research has practical implications for build-\\ning workplace trust. to build trust, managers have\\nto first identify thps in trust in their networks.\\nthe associations between types of trust and ex-\\nchange ties that we have identified is helpful for\\nmanagers striving to understand the trust that ex-\\nists in their networks. for example, if another per-\\nson solely provides task advice to a focal person,\\nthen it is likely that the focal person’s trust in the\\nother is instrumental rather than affective. if the\\nfocal person primarily provides economic aid to\\nthe other person, then it is likely that the other’s\\ntrust in the focal person comes from the head but\\n\\n2008 447chua, ingram, and morris\\n\\n\\n\\nnot the heart. such knowl is particularly use-\\nful for managers who seek to strhen their net-\\nwork ties. it informs them about types of trust that\\nmay be lacking in regions of their networks. it also\\ntells them what kinds of ties to develop to foster the\\nmissing trust.\\n\\nfurthermore, our research can help managers\\njudge the type of trust that exists between pairs of\\nother people, including their own network con-\\ntacts. trust between other people can be difficult to\\ngauge as it is a subjective psychological state. ex-\\nchange relationships, on the other hand, are easier\\nto see and can serve as cues for diagnosing the lines\\nof trust. knowl regarding the associations be-\\ntween network ties and trust can therefore help\\nmanagers better understand and influence the so-\\ncial dynamics among people around them.\\n\\nlimitations and future research directions\\n\\nan inherent problem in cross-sectional analyses\\nsuch as ours is determining the direction of causal-\\nity. reversed causality is more likely for our hy-\\npotheses regarding network ties than for those\\nregarding embeddedness. in the latter set of hy-\\npotheses, the independent variables are not di-\\nrectly influenced by ego, so it is unlikely that they\\nwould be a result of ego’s level of trust in alter.\\nconversely, it seems plausible that ego’s trust in\\nalter will affect the exchange relationship that ego\\nand alter share. however, we are not particularly\\ntroubled by the likelihood of a complex causal re-\\nlationship between the content of network ties and\\ntrust, because answering the question we set out to\\naddress in this study (i.e., how do managers trust\\ntheir network members?) does not depend on a\\nspecific causal argument. whether alter is a friend\\nbecause she is trusted, trusted because she is a friend,\\nor both, the evidence we present is nevertheless use-\\nful for locating trust in managers’ networks.\\n\\nanother limitation is common method bias,\\ngiven that our data came from an egocentric survey\\n(podsakoff, mackenzie, lee, & podsakoff, 2003).\\nfor example, participants could have biased our\\nresults by basing their responses to the trust mea-\\nsures on certain implicit beliefs about network ties\\nand trust. however, common method bias might\\nnot be a large problem for our study. hypotheses 1\\nto 4 concern how four types of network ties influ-\\nence two types of trust. our predictions are in\\ndifferent, sometimes opposite, directions for a\\ngiven type of trust (, affect-based trust is nega-\\ntively associated with economic resource ties but\\npositively associated with career guidance ties).\\ncommon method bias, as an undifferentiated\\nsource of bias, is unlikely to explain our findings\\n\\nbecause participants would have to simultaneously\\nconsider t implicit beliefs regarding tie type\\nand trust (four types of ties times two types of trust)\\nand complete the survey questions accordingly for\\nour findings to em; this can be very challng\\nbecause different types of network ties can co-occur\\nin different combinations. in fulfilling one implicit\\nbelief about how one type of trust should be related\\nto a given type of tie, a participant could easily\\nviolate the implicit belief about another tie-trust\\nrelationship. thus, it is highly unlikely that partic-\\nipants could have systematically biased the results.\\n\\nthe relationships between embeddedness and\\ntrust (hypotheses 5 and 6) also cannot be easily\\nexplained by common method bias. recall that em-\\nbeddedness was computed from a half-matrix that\\nparticipants completed after they listed all their\\nnetwork contacts. given the large network size (an\\naverage of 22 contacts per participant), it is un-\\nlikely participants responded in a systematically\\nbiased manner so as to maintain consistency or\\nfulfill some implicit belief about how the cell en-\\ntries in the half-matrix should be related to the trust\\nmeasures.\\n\\nour use of an egocentric approach, although\\ncommon in network research, has other limitations.\\nfor instance, participants’ recall of names is subject\\nto bias, as is their recall of ties between alters\\n(kilduff & krackhardt, 1994). future research that\\nreplicates our findings using a sociometric ap-\\nproach will be a valuable extension of our work.\\n\\nfuture research should also capitalize on our\\ncurrent set of findings to further explore how the\\ntwo types of trust relate to other organizational\\nvariables. for instance, we found that managers\\ntrust network members of different ranks differ-\\nently. the higher the rank of alters, the higher the\\ncognition-based trust they nder (our regression\\ncoefficient was positive for “higher rank” and neg-\\native for “lower rank”). this finding is consistent\\nwith prior research indicating that higher-level jobs\\nin organizations are usually associated with higher\\ntask discretion and high-trust psychological con-\\ntracts (fox, 1974; nicholson & johns, 1985). for\\naffect-based trust, however, there is a distinct neg-\\native effect only if alter outranks ego (the effect for\\n“higher rank” is significant and negative, but there\\nis no significant effect for “lower rank”). this no-\\ntable asymmetry has implications for research on\\nleader-member exchange (graen & cashman, 1975).\\ntrusting relationships between subordinates and\\nbosses are more likely to be built on cognitive bases\\nthan affective bases.\\n\\nfinally, although previous research has demon-\\nstrated that cognition- and affect-based trust may\\nlead to different outcomes (, mcallister, 1995),\\n\\n448 juneacademy of management journal\\n\\n\\n\\nthis effect has yet to be clearly demonstrated in\\nnetwork analyses. recently, some work has began\\nto differentiate the two types of trust in social net-\\nwork contexts (levin & cross, 2004), but many\\nquestions remain unexplored. for instance, what\\nimplications does the finding that economic re-\\nsource ties are positively associated with cognition-\\nbased trust yet negatively associated with affect-\\nbased trust have on the way businesspeople ge\\nin economic transactions with those in their net-\\nworks? does a manager’s trust in an embedded\\nnetwork member depend on the specific content of\\nthe ties by which the network member is embed-\\nded? furthermore, how do the two types of trust\\nmediate structural variables such as network den-\\nsity and specific dyadic interactions between net-\\nwork actors? these are but some of the many inter-\\nesting questions that derive from the recognition\\nthat there are different bases of trust located in\\ndifferent places in social networks.\\n'"

      " from the head and the heart locating cognition- and affect-based trust in managers professional networks roy yong joo chua paul ingram michael. morris columbia university this article investigates the configuration of cognition- and affect-based trust in managers professional networks examining how these two types of trust are associated with relational content and structure. results indicate that cognition-based trust is positively associated with economic resource task advice and career guidance ties whereas affect-based trust is positively associated with friendship and career guidance ties but negatively associated with economic resource ties. the extent of embeddedness in network through positive ties increases affect-based trust whereas that through negative ties decreases cognition-based trust. these findings illuminate how trust arises in networks and inform network research that invokes trust to explain managerial outcomes. central insight of organizational research is that managers rely on networks of relations for the resources information and support needed for career and business success. as businesses evolve toward flatter structures and more fluid boundaries the professional networks that managers develop become even more important. trust or the willingness to make oneself vulnerable to another person despite uncertainty regarding motives and prospective actions is often implicated when relationships in network involve the exchange of valuable resources. trust can foster greater cooperation and richer information exchange than would otherwise occur. these benefits of trust are frequently invoked in network theorizing to account for network effects on important managerial outcomes such as job mobility job satisfaction and knowl sharing. despite the pivotal role of trust in network theorizing there has been relatively little empirical research on what types of trust managers place in members of their professional networks and where in those networks these types of trust are most likely to occur. only few studies have explicitly measured managers experienced trust in their networks of professional relationships. furthermore although other areas of organizational and social science research have distinguished among the qualitatively different bases on which trust develops these distinctions have rarely been integrated into network research. in the present research we begin to redress this gap by applying the basic distinction between trust from the head versus trust from the heart that is cognition-based versus affect-based trust. specifically we examine the extent to which these two types of trust are associated with the relational content of the ties that make up professional network and an individual embeddedness in positive and negative ties to the other members of manager network. by examining how managers place trust in others from the head or the heart we hope to make several contributions. first the distinction between cognition- and affect-based trust calls to attention two distinct systems of social psychological processes. whereas cognitionbased trust involves calculative and instrumental assessment affect-based trust involves empathy rapport and self-disclosure. these processes of trusting differ experientially and have distinct antecedents and consequences. we develop method to capture these qualitatively different types of trust and illuminate their different academy of management journal vol.  no. . copyright of the academy of management all rights reserved. contents may not be copied emailed posted to listserv or otherwise transmitted without the copyright holder express written permission. users may print download or email articles for individual use only. associations with various properties of social networks. second we hope to provide service to researchers who study specific types of networks. different types of network ties are akin to the different types of networks that managers maintain. by elucidating how the two types of trust depend on the varying content of network ties we can gain more nuanced understanding of exchange relationships in professional networks. our research can therefore inform network researchers as to when they can assume the presence of what type of trust in the specific networks they study. third more detailed understanding of trust in social networks would enable researchers to build more precise theories. recent research has shown that cognition- and affect-based trust can lead to different outcomes. therefore network researchers who make further distinctions between the types of trust as opposed to treating it as unidimensional construct could make more precise predictions. theory development and hypotheses cognitive and affective bases of trust it is widely acknowld that trust arises through distinct psychological processes. central distinction is that between cognition- versus affect-based trust. cognition-based trust refers to trust from the head judgment based on evidence of another competence and reliability. it is an instrumental inference that one makes from information about the other behavior under specific circumstances. by contrast affect-based trust refers to trust from the heart bond that arises from one own emotions and sense of the other feelings and motives. with affect-based trust individuals express care and concern for the welfare of their partners and believe in the intrinsic virtue of such relationships. this type of trust usually involves emotional investment and is more enduring and generalizable over situations than is cognition-based trust. these two types of trust align with the broader distinction in social psychology between two basic dimensions on which people map others competence and warmth. the distinction between cognition- and affectbased trust has received considerable empirical support. in field study of managers mcallister found that ratings of many trust-related items reduced to two factors rather than one in confirmatory factor analysis. laboratory studies have yielded findings consistent with the mcallister study. moreover the two types of trust are differentially related both to consequences such as forms of organizational citizenship and cooperative behavior and to flows of tacit knowl. drawing on this evidence we argue that it is imperative to differentiate these two types of trust in network research. that is if particular networks are theorized to be helpful because they generate trust it is important to specify what type of trust it is and to empirically test the assumed associations. we expect that trust is associated with particular network properties but that these associations vary depending on the type of trust. we focus on the two basic properties identified in egocentric network research the tie types or content of exchange within relationship and the structure of interconnection surrounding relationship. we focus on these variables because network scholars agree that the two central concepts in network analysis are the structure of network and the content of the dyadic ties among social parties. for instance tichy described the transactional content of network ties as elementary properties of social networks. schweizer called the notion of embeddedness central to the social networks perspective. in their more recent review of the social network research paradigm kilduff described the primacy of relations or network ties as the most regularly invoked difference between network research and conventional social science research. they also described embeddedness as key concept in network research. the content of network ties and embeddedness we thank an anonymous reviewer for the observation that some network research treats trust networks as distinct type of network. these previous attempts to measure trust in networks using distinct namnerator have been methodologically limited to capturing only single type of trust. in our present research we treat trust as psychological state that has different bases and could arise in different types of network ties.  chua ingram and morris are also especially relevant to trust and the basis on which it develops. in their professional lives managers maintain different types of network ties to obtain different resources. some of these network ties are instrumental in nature whereas others are more socio-emotional or expressive. this diversity of network ties lends itself well to the investigation of the different ways that managers trust their network members. as for embeddedness the relevant literature identifies trust as an important mechanism behind its influence. in developing our hypotheses we began by considering how managers trust depends on the content of their ties to their network members. we then examined how trust depends on the network members embeddedness in managers networks. throughout this study we framed our hypotheses in terms of how trust is associated with the network variables although we acknowld the possibility of different causal direction. our goal was to clarify the ways managers trust others in their networks not necessarily to pinpoint the causal antecedents of trust. in particular one key objective of this research was to identify where in networks different types of trust occur. we nevertheless consider the issue of causal direction in more detail below in our discussion section. also for clarity of exposition throughout this article we adopt the network research convention of referring to focal individual as ego and to his or her network members as alters.  types of trust and relational content we first consider how an ego trusts alters connected by four different types of social exchanges in professional networks namely friendship and social support task advice economic and financial support and mentoring and career guidance. we chose to examine these network ties because they are common exchange relationships in managers professional lives. various prior network research studies have also examined one or more of these ties. we discuss each type of network tie separately and analyze its unique effects on trust although the tie types are by no means mutually exclusive. in fact given that managers network ties are often multiplex we hope to unpack the content of these network ties and show how different tie content is differentially associated with cognition- and affect-based trust. friendship ties. as managers pursue their careers they often forge friendship ties. friendship between two individuals typically starts with interpersonal attraction and grows with increased interaction. at the dyadic level friendship enhances cooperation encourages resource sharing and facilitates open communication. through friendship individuals also find mutual care and concern social comfort and enjoyment. these patterns of interpersonal interaction have been in turn linked to the development of emotional attachment intimacy and altruistic behavior. given that friendship embodies socio-emotional gements and positive perceptions of another motives the presence of friendship tie is especially likely to indicate affect-based trust. this is because the elements of friendship are the foundations upon which affect-based trust is built. friends perceive each other as having their interests and welfare at heart. this expectation of caring altruistic behavior fosters affect-based trust. the domaingeneral scope of friendship also suggests fit to affect-based trust given that this type of trust generalizes over circumstances. although friendship in professional settings may also contain elements of cognition-based trust such as prior history of positive interactions these elements are not specific to friendship relations. certainly professional competence and reliability are not necessary conditions for the development of friendship. hence we do not hypothesize relationship between friendship ties and cognition-based trust. hypothesis. in professional network the presence of friendship tie in which an ego gets friendship from an alter is positively associated with ego affect-based trust in alter. task advice ties. key function of managers networks is to help them seek information and advice for problem solving. task advice ties are channels through which managers obtain resources such as information assistance and guidance related to the completion of their work. in professional networks after an alter has provided an ego with useful taskrelated advice ego is likely to identify this alter as juneacademy of management journal someone who has the relevant expertise competence or experience in thven task domain. conversely an ego is also more likely to seek task advice from an alter who is perceived to be reliable and competent because such an alter is more likely to provide useful assistance. for instance hinds found that when selecting work partners individuals preferred those who had reputations for being competent. holste and fields showed that cognition-based trust predicted the use of information and knowl from others. hence we expected the presence of task advice tie to be positively associated with cognition-based trust. however alter being source of task advice to ego does not mean that socio-emotional relationship will necessarily develop between them. the flow of task advice and information in professional network can serve purely work purposes and lack exchanges on the personal level. any social interactions between ego and alter are likely to be conducted at arm lh until the two become friends. therefore we do not predict any specific relationship between task advice ties and affect-based trust. hypothesis. in professional network the presence of task advice tie in which an ego gets task advice from an alter is positively associated with ego cognition-based trust in alter. economic resource ties. managers sometimes seek economic resources from others in their networks as means to for example fund new projects or start business initiatives. economists have long acknowld that economic actions are influenced by the degree to which the involved parties trust each other. this is because economic transactions carry risks and threats of exploitation. in economic transactions the presence of trust can reduce the specification and monitoring of contracts reduce uncertainty and provide material incentives for cooperation. parties in an economic exchange also have incentives to behave in trustworthy manner if they expect to have future economic relations. this type of trust is calculative and instrumental and hence cognition-based. cognition-based trust may further develop following positive economic transactions. for instance after an alter has provided financial resources to help an ego achieve certain goals ego is likely to view this alter as financially capable and as one whom he or she can rely on for such help in the future. as the economic interaction gets repeated ego confidence in the competence and economic value of alter also increases. in sum although the relationship between economic exchange and cognition-based trust is likely to be reciprocal and undoubtedly complex theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that they are positively associated. hypothesis. in professional network the presence of an economic resource tie in which an ego gets economic resources from an alter is positively associated with ego cognitionbased trust in alter. conversely we expected economic resource ties to have the opposite relationship with affect-based trust. instrumentality and affect in the same relationship may undermine each other as reflected in the aphorism never lend money to friend.  indeed silver analysis of the modern western conception of friendship suggests that the very possibility of true affect depends on separation from instrumental concerns. although precept of contemporary economic sociology is that affective concerns brace economic pursuits they do not coexist effortlessly. for instance foa and foa suggested that resources from different relational domains tend to be incommensurable. this tension has been recognized in the network literature. in their study of friendships between competing hotel managers ingram and roberts found that managers were most likely to forge friendships when the instrumental value of those relationships was highest. at the same time the authors reported that while they had friends among other hotel managers these were not their closest friends. the instrumental component probably limits them as vehicles for sentiment. the imposition of instrumentality on affect is probably greatest when economic resources are at stake. unlike friendship and task advice money is fungible and easily quantifiable. it is therefore more naturally the subject of specific exchange the basis of instrumental relations rather than of thneralized exchange upon which affective relations are built. furthermore to the extent that economic decisions often involve the maximization of selfgain economic exchanges may reflect what sahlins called negative reciprocity type of reciprocity characterized by high degree of self-interest and lack of concern for the other. hence managers are not likely to develop deep positive chua ingram and morris affective relationships with those whom they engage in economic exchanges nor are they likely to view those to whom they are affectively close as sources of economic aid. this separation between instrumentality and affect should result in negative association between economic-resource ties and affect-based trust. hypothesis. in professional network the presence of an economic resource tie in which an ego gets economic resources from an alter is negatively associated with ego affect-based trust in alter. career guidance ties. career guidance such as mentoring is complex form of social exchange because it combines instrumental and socioemotional elements. kram described mentoring as set of roles and role functions that include coaching support and sponsorship. these functions can be broadly divided into two categories psychosocial mentoring and career enhancement mentoring. with psychosocial mentoring mentor provides socioemotional support and encouragement. with career enhancement mentoring the mentor imparts intellectual skills and knowl and provides career opportunities and exposure for his or her prot. although traditionally older individuals provide mentoring kram and isabella found that peers in an individual social network could also offer mentoring. in professional networks when given alter is provider of useful career advice and opportunities to given ego two types of perceptions are invoked. first ego is likely to perceive alter as having relevant experience competence and access to valuable information not available to him or her. this perception is the foundation of cognitionbased trust. second ego is also likely to perceive alter as genuinely caring about him or her because alter is willing to provide career guidance and advice. furthermore alters who provide ego with career advice are also likely to provide socioemotional support encouragement and confirmation in times of need. as result ego develops affect-based trust in these alters. in sum we argue that an ego is likely to have increased cognition- and affect-based trust in alters who provide him or her with career guidance information. hypothesis. in professional network the presence of career guidance tie in which an ego gets career guidance from an alter is positively associated with ego cognition- and affect-based trust in alter. how do managers trust embedded network members. the notion that trust in dyadic relationship may be affected by the network structure that surrounds it is at the heart of the concept of embeddedness. various researchers have concluded that interpersonal trust increases when relationship is embedded in ties to third parties. however these researchers have either inferred trust from the relationship between an ego and alter or relied on unidimensional measure of trust. we extend this line of research on embeddedness in two ways. first we differentiate between cognition- and affect-based trust. second we further distinguish between positive embeddedness and negative embeddedness. by positive embeddedness we refer to the extent to which an alter is connected to other alters by positive ties. these positive ties need not be affectively charged and can vary in strh. examples range from friendship to cooperative formal working relationships. by negative embeddedness we refer to the extent to which an alter is connected to other alters by negative ties. for example two alters might dislike each other and intentionally avoid or even attempt to harm each other. although negative relationships are relatively uncommon in networks their rarity makes them especially salient. indeed social psychological research has shown that negative information is given heavier wt and consideration than positive or neutral information because it represents potential threats or dangers. negative relationships are important to consider because they represent the liability side of the social lr and can affect organizational effectiveness. let us consider each form of embeddedness in turn. positive embeddedness. we propose that an alter positive embeddedness is positively associated with an ego affect-based trust in him or her. recall that cognition-based trust is more instrumental and calculative whereas affect-based trust is more socio-emotional. dense networks have been shown to provide social support and increase affect. these are conditions conducive to the development of affectbased trust. in addition the more connected an alter is by positive ties to other alters in an ego juneacademy of management journal network theater is the level of perceived solidarity the perception that alter is an integral part of ego in-group. with high positive embeddedness the force of group identity and cohesiveness strhens the socio-emotional bond with alter. thus ego should have higher affect-based trust in densely embedded alter because such an alter is more likely to be perceived as having ego welfare and interests at heart. is positive embeddedness also associated with cognition-based trust. to be sure embeddedness can provide better monitoring of an alter behaviors thereby increasing alter reliability. positive feedback from other alters might also increase an ego favorable perceptions of an alter. however in the presence of direct tie between ego and alter ego view of alter reliability and competence should be primarily associated with alter manifest skills and track record as opposed to secondhand information or third-party monitoring. in other words the degree to which alter is highly connected to ego other network members by positive ties may not greatly affect alter professional competence and reliability. hence although we predict that ego is likely to have affect-based trust in highly embedded alters we do not make specific predictions regarding the relationship between positive embeddedness and cognition-based trust. hypothesis. the more embedded an alter is in an ego network by positive ties the higher ego affect-based trust in alter. negative embeddedness. we propose that when given alter is connected to other alters in an ego network by negative ties ego trust in alter is undermined. this prediction is derived from balance theory according to which relationships between the pairs in triad are congruent. in other words if has positive relationships with and b and should have positive relationship with each other. if and have negative relationship will have to reconsider his or her positive tie with one of them. thus the more focal alter is connected by negative ties to other alters the more difficult it becomes for ego to maintain positive relationship with this focal alter. as result ego trust perceptions of the focal alter should be lower. the negative association between negative embeddedness and trust is likely to apply to both cognition- and affect-based trust. negative ties among alters can increase perceptions of intragroup conflict and decrease perceived group solidarity and cohesiveness thereby reducing affect-based trust. negative ties among alters can also lower ego cognition-based trust in focal alter because negative feedback or gossip obtained from other alters could undermine ego otherwise positive perceptions of his or her reliability and competence. it is useful to note the asymmetric effect of third-party feedback. positive information from third parties may not greatly influence ego cognition-based trust in alter but it is likely that negative information will. this is because negative information signals potential problems in future interactions with alter and thus stands out and ws more heavily in ego trust evaluations. moreover negative information is also disproportionately likely to be passed along to ego as it not only better serves the function of social vigilance but also makes for titillating gossip. hypothesis. the more embedded an alter is in an ego network by negative ties the lower ego cognition- and affect-based trust in alter. although trust plays central role in network theorizing its constituent elements have seldom been directly examined in network research. to bridge this gap we examined patterns of trust in professional networks. we found that not only do managers trust network members differently depending on the content of network ties but also that differences exist in how each type of trust is associated with different forms of embeddedness. specifically managers have more affect-based trust in network members who are friends sources of career guidance or densely embedded in their net chua ingram and morris works by positive ties. when network member is source of economic assistance managers affectbased trust in him or her actually decreases. cognition-based trust on the other hand is higher in those who provide task advice economic assistance or career guidance. whereas positive embeddedness has no effect on cognition-based trust negative embeddedness reduces this type of trust. theoretical implications our study has several theoretical implications for network research. first we offer more nuanced view regarding the existence of the different types of trust in social networks. in light of our findings it appears that the common assumption that trust exists in networks ties that involve the exchange of valuable resources provides only part of the story. sometimes network ties can be negatively associated with type of trust. our findings suggest for instance that when is connected to by an economic resource tie the level of cognition-based trust between and is higher than it might be otherwise but the level of affect-based trust is lower. thus network researchers studying economic exchange networks should be particularly careful when they invoke trust as part of their arguments.

positive embeddedness to model is.. . .  juneacademy of management journal this provocative finding concerning the negative association between affect-based trust and economic resource ties also points to fascinating tension that has so far been underplayed in the many applications of network theories to economic and organizational contexts. that is economic relations undermine affect-based trust. this is not to say affect-based trust never exists in those relationships clearly it does. rather our results suggest the opportunity for shift in the theoretical attention of network theorists from the implications of affect in economic contexts to the phenomenon of the very existence of such trust. the results here join efforts such as those of silver and zelizer in suggesting that the commingling of affect and economic exchange is not natural occurrence even if it is common one. the question of how affect and instrumentality may coexist provides rich opportunity to advance theories at the nexus of economy and society. our findings also highlight difference between task advice and career guidance ties. whereas task advice ties are positively associated with only cognition-based trust career guidance ties are positively associated with both cognition- and affect-based trust. therefore it is important for researchers studying advice networks to clearly specify the type of advice in which they are interested. although the provision of advice is generally associated with increased trust how managers trust those who provide them with advice depends on its specific content. the result that cognition- and affect-based trust are differentially associated with forms of embeddedness is also of notable theoretical importance. in the social network literature the most prominent argument regarding the benefits of dense network is that it provides social closure which in turn increases trust among network actors. although wnerally agree with this assertion our study suggests that the trust that is associated with dense network composed by positive ties is socio-emotional in nature. in other words actors believe that their densely embedded network members are trustworthy in that they belong to closely knit group and thus have each other interests and welfare at heart. actors do not necessarily perceive their densely embedded network members as being more competent or reliable. this distinction is important when researchers invoke the argument that dense network nders trust. the validity of this argument depends on the type of trust and the associated outcomes of interest. in addition we extended prior research on embeddedness and trust by examining the effects of negative embeddedness. we hypothesized that negative embeddedness would reduce both types of trust but only found evidence that negative embeddedness reduces cognition-based trust. one explanation could be that positive and negative embeddedness exert opposite influences on affect-based trust but that positive embeddedness is much more prevalent and hence has stronger effect. indeed only percent of listed alters had some level of negative embeddedness whereas percent had some level of positive embeddedness. conversely because positive embeddedness is unlikely to influence cognition-based trust the relationship between negative embeddedness and this type of trust becomes more pronounced. finally our results can be used to interpret findings from prior research. consider for example the study on sydney hotels by ingram and roberts. those researchers examined the friendship networks of hotel managers and found evidence of collusion and customer sharing two behavioral outcomes that depend on social cohesion and care and concern for each other. this finding is consistent with our finding that friendship ties are positively associated with affect-based trust. yet among these hotel managers who were friends there was not much evidence of knowl sharing behavior that depends more on cognition-based trust which is not primary element in friendship networks. practical implications recent research shows that trust in the workplace is an extremely valuable resource with significant effect on job satisfaction and well-being. the negotiation literature also suggests that people are more willing to cooperate with those whom they trust. hence knowl that can guide managers in developing trust in the workplace and in detecting trusting relationships among coworkers is likely to bring substantive benefits. our research has practical implications for building workplace trust. to build trust managers have to first identify thps in trust in their networks. the associations between types of trust and exchange ties that we have identified is helpful for managers striving to understand the trust that exists in their networks. for example if another person solely provides task advice to focal person then it is likely that the focal person trust in the other is instrumental rather than affective. if the focal person primarily provides economic aid to the other person then it is likely that the other trust in the focal person comes from the head but chua ingram and morris not the heart. such knowl is particularly useful for managers who seek to strhen their network ties. it informs them about types of trust that may be lacking in regions of their networks. it also tells them what kinds of ties to develop to foster the missing trust. furthermore our research can help managers judge the type of trust that exists between pairs of other people including their own network contacts. trust between other people can be difficult to gauge as it is subjective psychological state. exchange relationships on the other hand are easier to see and can serve as cues for diagnosing the lines of trust. knowl regarding the associations between network ties and trust can therefore help managers better understand and influence the social dynamics among people around them. limitations and future research directions an inherent problem in cross-sectional analyses such as ours is determining the direction of causality. reversed causality is more likely for our hypotheses regarding network ties than for those regarding embeddedness. in the latter set of hypotheses the independent variables are not directly influenced by ego so it is unlikely that they would be result of ego level of trust in alter. conversely it seems plausible that ego trust in alter will affect the exchange relationship that ego and alter share. however we are not particularly troubled by the likelihood of complex causal relationship between the content of network ties and trust because answering the question we set out to address in this study does not depend on specific causal argument. whether alter is friend because she is trusted trusted because she is friend or both the evidence we present is nevertheless useful for locating trust in managers networks. another limitation is common method bias given that our data came from an egocentric survey. for example participants could have biased our results by basing their responses to the trust measures on certain implicit beliefs about network ties and trust. however common method bias might not be large problem for our study. hypotheses to concern how four types of network ties influence two types of trust. our predictions are in different sometimes opposite directions for given type of trust. common method bias as an undifferentiated source of bias is unlikely to explain our findings because participants would have to simultaneously consider implicit beliefs regarding tie type and trust and complete the survey questions accordingly for our findings to em this can be very challng because different types of network ties can co-occur in different combinations. in fulfilling one implicit belief about how one type of trust should be related to given type of tie participant could easily violate the implicit belief about another tie-trust relationship. thus it is highly unlikely that participants could have systematically biased the results. the relationships between embeddedness and trust also cannot be easily explained by common method bias. recall that embeddedness was computed from half-matrix that participants completed after they listed all their network contacts. given the large network size it is unlikely participants responded in systematically biased manner so as to maintain consistency or fulfill some implicit belief about how the cell entries in the half-matrix should be related to the trust measures. our use of an egocentric approach although common in network research has other limitations. for instance participants recall of names is subject to bias as is their recall of ties between alters. future research that replicates our findings using sociometric approach will be valuable extension of our work. future research should also capitalize on our current set of findings to further explore how the two types of trust relate to other organizational variables. for instance we found that managers trust network members of different ranks differently. the higher the rank of alters the higher the cognition-based trust they nder. this finding is consistent with prior research indicating that higher-level jobs in organizations are usually associated with higher task discretion and high-trust psychological contracts. for affect-based trust however there is distinct negative effect only if alter outranks ego. this notable asymmetry has implications for research on leader-member exchange. trusting relationships between subordinates and bosses are more likely to be built on cognitive bases than affective bases. finally although previous research has demonstrated that cognition- and affect-based trust may lead to different outcomes juneacademy of management journal this effect has yet to be clearly demonstrated in network analyses. recently some work has began to differentiate the two types of trust in social network contexts but many questions remain unexplored. for instance what implications does the finding that economic resource ties are positively associated with cognitionbased trust yet negatively associated with affectbased trust have on the way businesspeople ge in economic transactions with those in their networks. does manager trust in an embedded network member depend on the specific content of the ties by which the network member is embedded. furthermore how do the two types of trust mediate structural variables such as network density and specific dyadic interactions between network actors. these are but some of the many interesting questions that derive from the recognition that there are different bases of trust located in different places in social networks. \n",
