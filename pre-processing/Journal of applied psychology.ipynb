lewandowsky & farrell, 2011;\\nroberts & pashler, 2000). vancouver, weinhardt, and schmidt\\n(2010) took the initial steps toward a formal theory of multiple-\\ngoal pursuit by developing the multiplal pursuit model\\n(mgpm), which is a cognitive model of approach goal striving.\\nthe model integrates control theory accounts of self-regulation\\n(carver & scheier, 1998) and classic, subjective expected utility\\naccounts of decision making (von neumann & morgenstern, 1947;\\n\\ntimothy ballard, uwa business school, university of western aus-\\ntralia, and school of psychology, university of queensland;

busemeyer & townsend, 1993; roe,\\nbusemeyer, & townsend, 2001), so that it provides a more so-\\nphisticated explanation of the complex choices encountered during\\nmultiplal pursuit, (b) extending the mgpm to account for\\navoidancals, and (c) demonstrating that the model can account\\nfor individual differences in prioritization strategy. the resulting\\nmodel, which we call the mgpm�, explains the process by which\\npeople make complex choices involving risk or uncertainty, while\\nstriving for approach and/or avoidancals.\\n\\nto evaluate the model, we first present a simulation study in\\nwhich we used the mgpm� to generate a set of predictions\\nregarding the effects of goal type (i.e., approach/avoidance) and\\nrisk on prioritization. we then test these predictions in an exper-\\niment. the empirical data from the experiment demonstrate that\\ngoal type and risk exert systematic effects on goal prioritization.\\nwe also show that the effects of these manipulations vary across\\nindividuals in a way that is consistent with the predictions of the\\nmgpm�. further, we demonstrate that the mgpm� provides a\\nbetter account of the data than the original mgpm, and that the\\nmajor extensions of mgpm� from the original model are justified.\\n\\nthe multiplal pursuit model\\n\\nthe mgpm (vancouver , 2010) is a cognitive model based\\non a control theory account of goal pursuit (, carver & scheier,\\n1998; lord & levy, 1994; powers, 1973; vancouver, 2008).\\ncontrol theory represents goal pursuit in terms of feedback control\\nsystems. thals that people pursue may be a feature of the\\nexternal world, such as publishing a certain number of papers to\\nachieve tenure; or internal to the person, such as keeping emotions\\nin check. according to control theory, the tendency to act on a goal\\n\\nis determined by the discrepancy between the perception of the\\ncurrent state of the variable being controlled and a reference state\\nfor that variable (i.e., thal). for example, if our assistant\\nprofessor has a goal of publishing 10 papers to obtain tenure, and\\nhas published five to date, the discrepancy is five. in the case of an\\napproach goal the aim is to reach thal, which eliminates the\\ndiscrepancy.\\n\\naccording to the mgpm, the choice between competing\\ngoals is determined by comparing the subjective expected util-\\nities of acting on each goal and then selecting thal with the\\nhighest expected utility. expected utility is a label commonly\\nused in the field of decision making (busemeyer, 2015). it\\nrepresents the multiplicative combination of a subjective sense\\nof probability (i.e., expectancy) and a subjective sense of value\\n(i.e., utility). these same concepts can be found in motivational\\ntheories such as expectancy theory (vroom, 1964), although the\\nlabels for the constructs vary. for example, utility is often\\nreferred to as valence or value in motivational theories (,\\nkanfer, 1991). in the mgpm, utility is referred to as valence.\\nvalence is the product of the discrepancy and gain, which is the\\nwt that represents the importance of thal to the indi-\\nvidual. gain can be affected by internal and external factors,\\nsuch as the value or framing of incentives associated with\\nobtaining thal.\\n\\nthe other component of expected utility is expectancy, which in\\nthe mgpm is derived by comparing a subjective sense of the\\nresources required to achieve thal, and a subjective sense of\\nthe resources available. the subjective sense of resources required\\n(, time needed) is based on the discrepancy and a belief\\nregarding the resources it takes to reduce the discrepancy. this\\nbelief is developed with experience, but is potentially biased as\\nwell (vancouver , 2014). in the empirical protocols used to\\ntest the mgpm, the resource was time and the availability of that\\nresource was determined by a deadline. because the discrepancy\\nand the amount of resources available (, the time to a deadline)\\nchange over time, the valence and expectancy of thal also\\nchange over time, which means that they are dynamic. the mgpm\\npredicts that as long as one perceives that there is sufficient time\\navailable to meet thals and thals’ importance are equal,\\nindividuals will tend to prioritize thal with the larger discrep-\\nancy. however, as the deadline approaches, the model predicts that\\npeople will prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy, be-\\ncause the perceived likelihood of achieving thal with the larger\\ndiscrepancy will have decreased.\\n\\nin support of these predictions, studies have demonstrated that\\npeople switch priority from thal with the largest discrepancy to\\nthe one with the smallest discrepancy as a deadline looms (louro,\\npieters, & zeelenb 2007; schmidt & dolis, 2009), though with\\na preference for thal with the higher incentive if differential\\nincentives exist (schmidt & deshon, 2007). these studies also\\nshowed individual differences, which the mgpm could account\\nfor via differences in the free parameters in the model. for exam-\\nple, people who were more sensitive to the time available demon-\\nstrated an earlier preference reversal. more recently, vancouver et\\nal. (2014) added a learning component to the mgpm, which\\nexplains how people learn to anticipate the effects of environmen-\\ntal disturbances on goal progress and form beliefs regarding re-\\nsources needed to achieve thal.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n2 ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\nintegration and unification\\n\\nan advantage of formal models is that they can be developed\\nprogressively and be extended to account for a broader range of\\nempirical phenomena. this process involves identifying the factors\\nthat limit the explanatory power of the model, and modifying the\\nmodel to address those factors, often by integrating mechanisms\\nfrom other psychological theories. this process of systematic\\nintegration and unification facilitates the cumulative development\\nof knowl and is regarded as the hallmark of a mature science\\n(anderson , 2004; hempel, 1966; newell, 1990; steel &\\nkonig, 2006). it also provides a way of addressing the so-called\\n“replication crisis” in psychology (open science collaboration,\\n2015; yong, 2012). the crisis is in part attributable to the fact that\\nresearch is often not cumulative. emphasis tends to be on effects\\nthat are counterintuitive and chall conventional thinking,\\nrather than the systematic development and testing of theories that\\ncan account for the benchmark phenomena within a field. in this\\npaper, we focus on different types of choices, goals, and strategies\\nto broaden the range of phenomena the model can explain.\\n\\ntypes of choices\\n\\nthe original mgpm has only been applied to relatively simple\\nchoice problems. in these choices, each action has a single known\\nconsequence. for example, in the schmidt and deshon (2007)\\nexperimental paradigm, participants had to create class schedules\\nfor students from two different colleges. there was a line of students\\nfrom each college, and the participants had to create class schedules for\\nevery student in each line. when they completed a schedule for a\\nstudent, the number of students in line for that student’s college\\nwould always decrease by one, reducing the discrepancy between\\nthe current state and goal state for the line. furthermore, the\\noriginal mgpm assumes that the person develops an expected\\nutility based on the consequence of an action in relation to a single\\ngoal. for example, the model determines the expected utility of\\nworking on a schedule for a student from college a based on the\\ndiscrepancy for college a. however, choices often involve more\\nthan one potential consequence. furthermore, these consequences\\noften need to be considered in relation to more than onal. for\\nexample, the assistant professor in our ongoing example cannot be\\ncertain that she will obtain a publication if she prioritizes her\\nresearch over the summer. she also needs to consider the possi-\\nbility that prioritizing research may or may not lead to a poor\\nteaching rating, and thus that the potential benefit for the research\\ngoal could come at the cost of the teaching goal.\\n\\nthe mgpm needs a more sophisticated decision mechanism to\\naccount for the types of complex choice problems described above.\\nthe decision mechanism within the original mgpm is derived\\nfrom classic theories of decision making, such as subjective ex-\\npected utility theory (seu; edwards, 1954) and its derivatives,\\nsuch as expectancy theory (vroom, 1964). classic theories assume\\nthat people make decisions by comparing the expected utilities of\\nvarious actions, and selecting the action with the highest expected\\nutility. an seu model provides a reasonable first approximation\\nfor performance on relatively simple choice problems, such as\\nthose to which the mgpm has been applied to date. however, it is\\nunlikely to account for performance on more complex problems.\\nstudies have consistently demonstrated that people violate many\\nof the assumptions of seu theory, and there is a wide range of\\n\\nempirical phenomena for which seu theory and its derivatives\\ncannot account. for example, people do not always choose the\\noption with the highest expected utility (edwards, 1955; mosteller\\n& nogee, 1951), and preferences for options may reverse depend-\\ning on time pressure (dror, basola, & busemeyer, 1999) or the\\nmethod by which choices are elicited (johnson & busemeyer,\\n2005). furthermore, choices are influenced not only by differences\\nin expected utilities, but also by the degree of uncertainty involved\\nin a decision (, busemeyer, 1985). finally, seu models as-\\nsume that people make choices rationally by systematically assess-\\ning the likelihood and value of all the potential consequences of\\neach action. however, humans have limited information process-\\ning capacity, and do not always fully consider the consequences of\\ntheir actions (fu & gray, 2006).\\n\\nto provide a more sophisticated explanation for the types of\\ncomplex choices encountered during multiplal pursuit, we\\nextend the mgpm by integrating it with dft (busemeyer &\\ntownsend, 1993). dft was developed in response to the limita-\\ntions of classic decision theories and is capable of accounting for\\nbehavior on complex choice problems, such as those involving risk\\nand uncertainty. this theory is a member of a class of decision\\nmodels known as sequential sampling models (brown & heath-\\ncote, 2008; donkin, brown, heathcote, & wagenmakers, 2011;\\nratcliff & mckoon, 2008). sequential sampling models provide a\\ndynamic, cognitive explanation for how people make decisions.\\nthey describe how the preference for a given course of action\\nevolves over time as one considers the different consequences\\nassociated with each action.\\n\\ntypes of goals\\n\\nthere are several different types of goals that people can pursue.\\none important distinction is between approach and avoidance\\ngoals. an approach goal is defined as a desirable state individuals\\nwish to reach, whereas an avoidancal is defined as an unde-\\nsirable state from which individuals wish to keep away (elliot &\\ncovington, 2001). despite a long history of research on approach\\nand avoidance motivation (, brown, 1948; hull, 1938; lewin,\\n1935), surprisingly little research has examined the role of avoid-\\nancals in a multiplal pursuit context. research that has\\nfocused on avoidancal pursuit has examined the causes and\\neffects of avoidancal pursuit, but has largely failed to consider\\nhow the process itself works. for example, elliot and church’s\\n(1997) hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement\\nmotivation identifies antecedents (, motivation, expectancy)\\nand consequences (, performance) of pursuing avoidance as\\ncompared to approach goals. other work focuses on understanding\\nhow personality influences whether people pursue approach or\\navoidancals (, elliot & thrash, 2002). gable’s (2006)\\ntheory of approach and avoidance social motivation describes how\\ndispositional motives and the features of one’s social environment\\ninfluence the type of goals one pursues. although this work reveals\\nfactors that influencal adoption and outcomes associated with\\npursuing different types of goals, it provides little insight into the\\nfactors that influence motivation or decision making during that\\npursuit.\\n\\ncarver and scheier (1998) argue that different psychological\\nprocesses are required for the pursuit of approach and avoidance\\ngoals. an important difference between approach and avoidance\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n3the mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\nlies in the dynamics of valence. when pursuing approach goals,\\nvalence should decrease as one moves closer to thal. however,\\nwhen pursuing avoidancals, valence should increase as one\\nmoves closer to thal, because thal is an undesired state.\\nthese arguments suggest that the decision-making architecture for\\napproach and avoidancals may not be the same. we enable the\\nmgpm� to account for avoidancals by modifying the valence,\\nexpectancy, and expected utility functions within the original\\nmgpm.\\n\\nstrategies\\n\\nstudies of multiplal pursuit have shown that there are\\nindividual differences in the way that people prioritizals (ore-\\nhek & vazeou-nieuwenhuis, 2013; schmidt, dolis, & tolli,\\n2009). these studies have all used approach goals, and have shown\\nthat some people tend to work on thal with the largest dis-\\ncrepancy at a given point in time. in an approach context, thal\\nwith the largest discrepancy is the one in the worst position,\\nbecause it is the furthest from attainment. the dynamic pattern that\\nems from this behavior is one in which the person switches\\nback and forth between goals as the relative discrepancy changes\\n(referred to as the “concurrent strategy”). other people tend to\\nwork on thal that has the smallest discrepancy (i.e., thal in\\nthe best position). the dynamic pattern that ems from this\\nbehavior is one in which the person works on onal until it has\\nbeen, or is close to being, achieved (referred to as the “sequential\\nstrategy”). although the original mgpm has been used to explain\\nthe concurrent strategy, it has not yet been used to account for the\\nsequential strategy. in this paper, we examine the different strat-\\negies people use when pursuing approach and avoidancals, and\\nassess whether the mgpm� can account for each one. the results\\nof our study show that there are individual differences in strategies\\namong people pursuing approach goals, but not among people\\npursuing avoidancals, and that the mgpm� can account for\\nthese effects.\\n\\ndecision field theory\\n\\nto enable the mgpm� to account for the more complex choice\\nproblems encountered during multiplal pursuit we integrate\\nthe mgpm with dft (busemeyer & townsend, 1993). dft is a\\nsequential sampling model developed to explain the mechanisms\\ninvolved in decision making under risk and uncertainty. the theory\\nis capable of accounting for a wide range of empirical phenomena\\nthat could not be explained by any one previous theory, including\\nviolations of stochastic dominance, violations of independence\\nbetween alternatives, the relationship between choice probability\\nand decision time, the effects of time pressure on choice accuracy,\\nand the effects of changes in risk or uncertainty on choice proba-\\nbility (busemeyer & townsend, 1993).\\n\\nthere are several reasons why dft is the ideal candidate for\\nintegration with the mgpm. first, dft is a formal, dynamic\\nmodel of decision making that describes how goals influence\\ndecision making. like the mgpm, it assumes that the subjective\\nvalue of acting on a goal changes as the person makes progress\\ntoward or away from that goal (busemeyer, dimperio, & jessup,\\n2006). this makes dft amenable to integration with the mgpm,\\nbecause they share the same basic assumptions. second, it pro-\\n\\nvides a general account of decision making involving any number\\nof goals, actions, and consequences, whereas the original mgpm\\nonly addresses choices between two actions where each action\\nonly affects onal. thus, dft enables the mgpm� to gener-\\nalize to more complex situations than the mgpm. third, dft was\\ndeveloped to explain how people make choices involving risk or\\nuncertainty, which is one type of complex choice problem we seek\\nto understand in this paper. finally, dft provides an explanation\\nof the internal dynamics of the decision process, because it de-\\nscribes how preferences develop over time and eventually produce\\na choice. by contrast, the original mgpm treats the decision\\nprocess as static.\\n\\ndft assumes that people make a choice between two or more\\nactions. actions can have any number of possible consequences,\\nand each consequence may be considered in relation to one or\\nmorals. in our ongoing example, the assistant professor faces\\na choice between two actions for the summer: focusing on research\\nor focusing on teaching. there are at least four potential conse-\\nquences of each action. for example, if she focuses on her re-\\nsearch, she might: (a) succeed in getting a paper published, but\\nreceive a poor teaching rating in the following semester; (b)\\nsucceed in getting a paper published, without receiving a poor\\nteaching rating; (c) fail to get the paper published, and receive a\\npoor teaching rating; or (d) fail to get the paper published, without\\nreceiving a poor teaching rating. some of these consequences may\\nnot be fully considered by the decision maker, particularly if the\\ndecision is being made rapidly or the preference for one option\\ndominates the others.\\n\\ndft uses the term motivational value to describe the attractive-\\nness of a consequence. motivational value is a function of two\\nfactors: the need to act on each goal and the quality of the\\nconsequence in relation to each goal (busemeyer, dimperio, &\\njessup, 2006; busemeyer, townsend, & stout, 2002). the need to\\nact is a function of the discrepancy between the current state and\\nthal. quality refers to the degree of satisfaction that a conse-\\nquence provides with respect to a particular goal. in thal\\npursuit context, quality is proportional to the change in discrep-\\nancy that would occur if that particular consequence arose.\\n\\nto make the example more concrete, table 1 displays the\\nqualities associated with the assistant professor’s research and\\nteaching goals. as can be seen, having the paper accepted would\\nhave a quality of one with respect to the research goal because it\\nbrings our assistant professor one paper closer to achieving her\\ngoal of publishing 10 papers. having the paper rejected would\\nhave a quality of zero with respect to the research goal because it\\nbrings her no closer to that goal. receiving a good teaching rating\\nwould have a quality of zero with respect to the teaching goal\\nbecause it brings her no closer to the undesired state that she is\\n\\ntable 1\\nqualities associated with teaching and research

ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\nstriving to avoid. receiving a poor teaching rating would have a\\nquality of �1 with respect to the teaching goal because it brings\\nher one course closer to the avoidancal. thus, the motivational\\nvalue of having the paper accepted will be larger when she is a\\nlong way from her research goal. the motivational value of re-\\nceiving a poor teaching rating will be larger (i.e., more negative)\\nwhen she is close to the undesired teaching goal.\\n\\ndft assumes that when comparing actions, individuals cannot\\nsimultaneously attend to all of the possible consequences of each\\naction, because they have limited information processing capacity.\\ntherefore, individuals shift their attention between possible con-\\nsequences as they deliberate over the decision (busemeyer &\\ntownsend, 1993; busemeyer & diederich, 2002; roe , 2001).\\naccording to dft, at each point in time the person considers one\\npotential consequence of each action. the probability of a person\\npaying attention to a consequence at a given point in time is\\nreferred to as the attention wt. the attention wt reflects the\\nperceived likelihood of a consequence occurring if a particular\\naction is selected.\\n\\nfor example, table 2 displays four possible consequences as-\\nsociated with prioritizing teaching or research as well as possible\\nattention wts associated with each consequence. in this exam-\\nple, when considering the consequences of prioritizing research,\\nthe assistant professor is most likely to pay attention to the possi-\\nbility of publishing a paper, but receiving a poor teaching rating.\\nwhen considering the consequences of prioritizing teaching, she is\\nmost likely to pay attention to the possibility of receiving a good\\nteaching rating, but not publishing a paper.\\n\\nat each point in time, the person compares the consequences\\nbeing attended to for each action. this comparison results in a\\nmomentary perception of the relative attractiveness of each action,\\nwhich is referred to as the momentary attractiveness. unlike ex-\\npected utility in the mgpm, which only varies in response to\\nchanges in the environment, momentary attractiveness also varies\\nas the person considers different consequences of an action—\\nconsequences that are considered sequentially as the person makes\\nthe decision. for example, our assistant professor might consider\\nthat if she prioritizes research, she may get a publication without\\nreceiving a poor teaching rating, whereas if she prioritizes her\\nteaching, she may avoid obtaining a poor teaching rating, but will\\nnot get a publication, either. at that point in time, prioritizing\\nresearch work would be more attractive to the assistant professor\\nthan prioritizing teaching. thus, the momentary attractiveness of\\nfocusing on research would be positive, whereas the momentary\\nattractiveness of focusing on teaching would be negative. when\\nthe assistant professor shifts her attention to alternative conse-\\n\\nquences, the momentary attractiveness of each action changes. for\\nexample, the assistant professor may then consider the possibility\\nthat if she prioritizes research, she may get a publication, but at the\\ncost of receiving a poor teaching rating. at this point in time,\\nfocusing on research would become less attractive.\\n\\nwithin dft, the transitory momentary attractiveness of each\\naction cumulates during the sampling process to determine a\\npreference. for example, if the assistant professor continues to\\nfocus on consequences that make focusing on research appear\\nmore attractive than focusing on teaching, her preference for\\nprioritizing research will increase over time. if she then focuses on\\nconsequences that make prioritizing teaching appear more attrac-\\ntive, her preference for prioritizing teaching will start to increase.\\nshe will continue to shift attention between different consequences\\nwhile comparing the actions, until the preference for one of the\\nactions exceeds a threshold. at this point, the action for which\\npreference breached the threshold is selected.\\n\\nthe threshold represents the strh of preference required\\nbefore one is willing to select a course of action. lower thresholds\\ngenerally lead to faster, but less accurate decisions. higher thresh-\\nolds generally lead to slower, but more accurate decisions (brown\\n& heathcote, 2008; ratcliff & mckoon, 2008). use of the thresh-\\nold parameter therefore enables dft to naturally accommodate\\nboth rapid (i.e., heuristic) and slow (i.e., analytic) decision making.\\nthresholds have been shown to relate to stable factors (, need\\nfor closure; brown, rae, bushmakin, & rubin, 2015) that influ-\\nence how cautious or urgent individuals are when making deci-\\nsions. however, this parameter can also be influenced by environ-\\nmental factors such as perceived time pressure (dror , 1999).\\n\\nfigure 1 shows an example of the sequential sampling process\\nas the assistant professor considers the potential consequences of\\nthe different courses of action. when making a choice between two\\nactions, preference is expressed on a bipolar continuum, with\\npositive values indicating a preference for one action and negative\\nvalues indicating a preference for the other action. as can be seen,\\nher preference for focusing on research versus teaching was ini-\\ntially equal (i.e., preference had a value of zero). as deliberation\\n(i.e., sampling) proceeded, preference first accumulated in the\\nnegative direction (i.e., in favor of prioritizing teaching). however,\\nas deliberation continued, preference started to accumulate in the\\npositive direction (i.e., in favor of research). eventually, prefer-\\nence breached the threshold in the positive direction and the\\nassistant professor decided to prioritize research.\\n\\ndevelopment of the mgpm�\\n\\nin this section, we introduce the mgpm�. like the mgpm, the\\nmgpm� assumes that individuals monitor the discrepancy be-\\ntween their current state and their goal. the discrepancy and the\\nimportance (i.e., gain) of thal together determine the valence\\nof acting on thal. the person also monitors resources (,\\ntime) available and the expected resources required to reach the\\ngoal, and the difference between these influences the expectancy of\\nreaching thal. valence and expectancy combine to determine\\nthe expected utility of thal, which represents one’s motivation\\nto act on thal at a given point in time. as summarized in table\\n3, the mgpm� introduces several modifications to the mgpm to\\nenable the model to explain more complex choice problems, and to\\naccount for the effects of avoidancals.\\n\\ntable 2\\nexample of possible attention wts for the consequences of\\nprioritizing teaching versus

mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\nlike dft, the mgpm� assumes that people do not have suffi-\\ncient capacity to systematically assess the expected utility of each\\naction when those actions have multiple possible consequences.\\ninstead, people deliberate over the decision, considering the vari-\\nous consequences sequentially. the attractiveness of a conse-\\nquence, referred to as motivational value, is determined by the\\npotential change in discrepancy for each goal (i.e., qualities) and\\nthe expected utilities of thosals. at a given point in time, the\\nperson considers one potential consequence for each action. the\\nrelative attractiveness of each consequence being considered\\ndetermines the momentary attractiveness of the actions. as the\\nperson considers different consequences over time, they de-\\nvelop preferences for the different actions. the person contin-\\nues to consider different consequences until preference for one\\naction reaches a threshold, at which point that action is selected.\\n\\nfigure 2 provides a graphical summary of the mgpm�. the\\nfigure summarizes a dynamic process involving goals a and b,\\nwhere actions x and y are being considered and where each action\\nhas consequence 1 and 2. the figure is divided into three layers.\\nthe first layer, expected utility of goals, illustrates the mechanisms\\nthat determine the expected utility of acting on each goal. in this\\nlayer, ua and ub denote the expected utility of goals a and b\\nrespectively. the second layer, motivational value of conse-\\nquences, illustrates how the expected utility of acting on each goal\\ncombines with the quality of each consequence to determine the\\nmotivational value of the possible consequences for each action. in\\nthis layer, mx1 and mx2 denote the possible consequences of action\\nx, whereas my1 and my2 denote the possible consequences of\\naction y. the third layer, choice of action, illustrates how the\\nmotivational values and the attention wts combine to influence\\nthe choice process. in the subsections that follow we provide the\\nmathematical specification for the model.\\n\\ndiscrepancy\\n\\nlike the original mgpm, the mgpm� assumes that goals are\\nreference values or standards, and that the person compares the\\ncurrent state of the variable (s) to thal (g) to determine a\\ndiscrepancy. the sign of the discrepancy is determined by whether\\nor not the reference value has been surpassed. we define the\\ndiscrepancy as positive when the reference value has not been\\nsurpassed, so that it decreases as the current state moves closer to\\nthe reference value. this definition enables the mgpm� to be\\napplicable across a range of goal pursuit scenarios. we have used\\nthe example of the academic trying to publish at least 10 papers (an\\napproach goal), while ensuring that she does not receive more than\\n3 poor teaching ratings (an avoidancal). this example is a\\nscenario in which the person is trying to ensure that a variable is\\ngreater than or equal to its reference value (for the approach goal)\\nand trying to prevent a variable from reaching or exceeding its\\nreference value (for the avoidancal). in these situations, the\\ndiscrepancy is calculated by subtracting the current state of the\\nvariable from thal (d � s � g). a positive discrepancy occurs\\nwhen the variable’s value is less than thal, which in this\\nscenario means that thal has not yet been surpassed.\\n\\nof course, other scenarios are possible. in some situations, a\\ngoal is surpassed when the variable’s value drops below the\\nreference value. an example is a manager trying to bring the\\nnumber of safety incidents down to an acceptable level. this is an\\napproach goal, because it is a desired state that the person is\\nstriving to achieve. however in this case, the discrepancy is\\ncalculated by subtracting thal from the current state (, if\\nthere are currently 10 incidents per month, and thal is 5, then\\nthe discrepancy is �5). the same is true if the person is trying to\\nprevent the variable from reaching or falling below the reference\\nvalue, such as a manager trying to prevent the firm’s capital\\nreserves from falling below a particular level. this represents an\\navoidancal, because the person is trying to prevent the system\\nreaching an undesired state. in this case, the discrepancy is positive\\nwhen the starting capital reserve level is above thal, and it\\ndecreases as the capital reserves are drained away.\\n\\nvalence\\n\\nthe mgpm assumes that the valence of an approach goal\\ndecreases as the person moves closer to thal. consider the\\nexample of the assistant professor aiming for 10 papers before her\\ntenure deadline. when she only has one paper, the valence of\\nacting on that goal will be high, but as shts more papers and\\nthus closer to achieving her goal, the valence of acting on thal\\nwill reduce. in contrast, the valence of an avoidancal should\\nincrease as one moves closer to thal (carver & scheier, 1998).\\nwhen the assistant professor has not yet received any poor teach-\\ning ratings, the valence of acting on the teaching goal will be low,\\nbecause she is a long way from the undesired state. however, if\\nshe starts getting poor teaching ratings, the valence of acting on\\nthat goal should increase. to account for this relationship, we\\nintroduce an intercept parameter (b), which represents the valence\\nof acting on thal when the current state is equal to thal. for\\napproach goals, we assume that the intercept is zero such that the\\nvalence decreases as the person gets closer to thal. thus, for\\napproach goals like those considered by the mgpm the intercept\\nneed not be included in the valence formula.

(1)\\n\\nthe subscript k denotes thal and (t) denotes the time. thus,\\nvk(t) represents the valence of goal k at time t.\\n\\nexpectancy\\n\\nexpectancy has traditionally been conceptualized as the subjec-\\ntive likelihood of an event occurring (edwards, 1954; vroom,\\n1964). when represented mathematically, expectancy is tradition-\\n\\nally bounded between zero and one, with zero indicating that the\\noccurrence of the event is impossible and one indicating that the\\nevent is certain. a value of 0.5 indicates that there is a 50% chance\\nthat the event will occur, which is the point of maximum uncer-\\ntainty. the original mgpm did not represent expectancy as a\\nsubjective probability. in particular, it had no upper limit. this\\nrepresentation creates difficulties when dealing with avoidance\\ngoals. specifically, to deal with avoidancals we bound expec-\\ntancy by zero and one. bounding expectancy in this way allows us\\nto treat it like a subjective probability in which the likelihood of an\\nevent not occurring is equal to one minus the likelihood of the\\nevent occurring. to accomplish this bounding we use a logistic\\nfunction. logistic functions are commonly used in neural network\\nmodels to constrain function outputs to a particular range (hill,\\nmarquez, o’connor, & remus, 1994) and are used in psychophys-\\nical models to describe how people respond to changes in stimulus\\nintensity (wichmann & hill, 2001).\\n\\nfigure 2. graphical summary of the mgpm�. the figure assumes that one is pursuing goals a and b, where\\nactions x and y are being considered and where each action has consequence 1 and 2. the symbols are defined\\nas follows: d � discrepancy; v � valence; � � gain; b � valence intercept; e � expectancy; ta � time\\navailable; � � time sensitivity; � � expected lag; u � expected utility; m � motivational value; q � quality;\\nw � attention wts; a � momentary attractiveness; p � preference; � � threshold.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n8 ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\nthe mgpm� defines the expectancy (e) of reaching a desired or\\nundesired statven the resources available. as with the mgpm,\\nwe assume time is the key resource. hence, the time required (tr)\\nis subtracted from the time available (ta). the difference is\\nwted by a time sensitivity parameter (�) that represents the\\nindividual’s sensitivity to the difference between ta and tr. these\\nelements are placed in a logistic function to obtain the bounded\\nexpectancy values needed to represent both approach and avoid-\\nancals. the full equation is as follows:\\n\\nek(t) �\\n1\\n\\n1 � exp[�� · (tak(t) � trk(t))]\\n. (2)\\n\\nequation 2 provides a convenient way to capture the effects of\\nuncertainty associated with goal pursuit and time. according to\\nthis function, expectancy should approach one as the difference\\nbetween ta and tr becomes larger because the person should\\nbecome more certain of reaching thal in the time available.\\nexpectancy should approach zero as the difference between ta\\nand tr becomes smaller because the person should become more\\ncertain of not reaching thal in the time available. expectancy\\nshould equal 0.5 when tr equals ta, because this is the point of\\nmaximum uncertainty, when the chances of reaching thal\\nbefore the deadline are equal to the chances not reaching it by the\\ndeadline. thus, this equation also provides an improvement on the\\noriginal mgpm, because it assumes that when the time required to\\nreach thal is equal to the time available, a person should expect\\na 50/50 chance of reaching a goal. by contrast, the original mgpm\\nassumed that the expectancy of reaching thal should be 0 in\\nthis situation.\\n\\nwe assume that time sensitivity may be influenced by both\\nindividual differences and environmental factors. for example,\\ndifferences in impulsiveness may produce differences in time\\nsensitivity (monterosso & ainslie, 1999; vancouver , 2010).\\ndifferences in the flexibility of a deadline might also influence the\\nsensitivity to time (, preparing a conference presentation com-\\npared to preparing the first submission of a paper). higher values\\nof � mean that expectancy, and therefore an individual’s decision,\\nis more sensitive to the difference between the time available and\\nexpected time required (see figure 4). likewise, lower values of �\\n\\nindicate a lower level of sensitivity. in the simulation of the\\nmgpm� section, we demonstrate that variability in time sensitivity\\ncan account for individual differences in whether people display\\nthe concurrent or sequential strategies.\\n\\nwe should note that the mgpm�’s time sensitivity parameter is\\nconceptually similar to the ‘timin’ parameter in the mgpm.\\nboth parameters influence the relationship between time and ex-\\npectancy. the difference between the two parameters is that time\\nsensitivity reflects sensitivity to the difference between ta and tr,\\nwhereas timin reflects sensitivity only to ta. we made this\\nchange so that the parameter would still have a meaningful effect\\n\\nfigure 3. valence as a function of discrepancy for approach and avoidancals.\\n\\nγ= 0\\n\\nγ= 0.2\\n\\nγ= 1\\n\\n0.00\\n\\n0.25\\n\\n0.50\\n\\n0.75\\n\\n1.00\\n\\n−10 −5 0 5 10\\n\\ntime available − time required\\n\\ne\\nxp\\n\\nec\\nta\\n\\nnc\\ny\\n\\nfigure 4. expectancy as a function of the difference between time\\navailable and time required, and time sensitivity (�). see the online article\\nfor the color version of this figure.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n9the mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\nafter the addition of the logistic function. when using this func-\\ntion, multiplying the parameter with the difference between ta and\\ntr produces clear effects on expectancy (see figure 4), whereas\\nmultiplying the parameter only with ta has effects that are much\\nmore difficult to interpret.\\n\\nfollowing the mgpm, we define tr as the product of discrep-\\nancy and expected lag (�). tr is dynamic because discrepancies\\ncan change. expected lag is a belief regarding the time needed to\\nmove one unit of discrepancy closer to thal. expected lag can\\nchange based on experience with the task (vancouver , 2014)\\nor environmental cues (, there may be only one opportunity per\\nsemester for our assistant professor to obtain teaching ratings). the\\nexpected time required is defined as follows:\\n\\ntrk(t) � dk(t) · �k(t). (3)\\n\\nexpected utility\\n\\naccording to the mgpm, a goal’s expected utility is the product\\nof valence and expectancy. however, this equation needs modifi-\\ncation to account for the fact that high expectancies likely ad-\\nversely affect the expected utility of avoidancals. expectancy\\nis positively related to the expected utility of an approach goal\\nbecause a high expectancy indicates a high likelihood of reaching\\nthe desired goal. expectancy should be negatively related to ex-\\npected utility of an avoidancal because the person is trying not\\nto reach thal. there are a number of ways that this idea could\\nbe implemented within a model. a simple way is to define ex-\\npected utility using separate equations for approach and avoidance\\ngoals. for approach goals, expected utility (u) is defined as\\nfollows:\\n\\nuk(t) � vk(t) · ek(t). (4a)\\n\\nfor avoidancals, expected utility is positively related to the\\nexpectancy of not reaching thal in the time available. because\\nwe have modified the specification of expectancy to include an\\nupper bound of one, expectancy can be treated like a probability.\\nthe expectancy of not reaching thal is therefore equal to one\\nminus the expectancy of reaching thal. the expected utility of\\nacting on an avoidancal is therefore defined as follows:\\n\\nuk(t) � vk(t) · [1 � ek(t)]. (4b)\\n\\nmotivational value\\n\\ndft assumes that motivational value is a function of quality\\n(i.e., the perceived impact of a consequence on goal progress) and\\ndiscrepancy. the expectancy of achieving a goal is not represented\\nin dft, because the problems dft has addressed are not the type\\nwhere expectancy is likely to have a strong influence, such as the\\nsatisfaction of hunger or safety (, busemeyer & diederich,\\n2002; busemeyer , 2006). however, people need to consider\\nthe likelihood of goal attainment when dealing with achievement\\ngoals, because there is no point spending time pursuing a goal that\\nis unachievable (schmidt & dolis, 2009; vancouver , 2010).\\nthe mgpm� therefore assumes that the motivational value of a\\nconsequence is a function of quality and the expected utility of\\nacting on thal. thus, the motivational value of having the\\npaper accepted will be higher to the extent that it is possible to\\nachieve thal of 10 papers in the time remaining before the\\n\\ntenure deadline. the mgpm� defines the motivational value of a\\nconsequence of an action as follows:\\n\\nmij(t) � �k uk(t) · qijk(t). (5)\\nthe subscripts i and j denote the action and consequence re-\\n\\nspectively. thus, mij(t) represents the motivational value of con-\\nsequence j of action i at time t.\\n\\nattention\\n\\naccording to dft, the focus of attention at a given point in\\ntime is determined stochastically. for each action, each conse-\\nquence has a probability that the person will attend to it, which\\nis referred to as the attention wt (wij). dft assumes that the\\nattention wt is related to the probability of the consequence\\noccurring—people are more likely to pay attention to the most\\nlikely consequences. for example, our assistant professor may\\nbelieve that if she focuses on her teaching, she will avoid\\nreceiving a poor teaching rating. she is therefore more likely to\\npay attention to this possibility when considering the conse-\\nquences of focusing on teaching. this assumption is supported\\nby eye tracking studies demonstrating that when making deci-\\nsions with consequences that vary in their probability of occur-\\nring, people fixate more on outcomes that are more probable\\n(fiedler & glöckner, 2012). the attention allocated to a par-\\nticular consequence of an action at a given moment is referred\\nto as the momentary attention and is denoted wij(t). momentary\\nattention can only be allocated to one consequence at a time for\\neach action. thus, wij(t) is equal to either 1 (denoting attention\\nallocated) or 0 (no attention allocated), and the total attention\\nallocated across all consequences for a particular action at\\nany given moment equals 1 (i.e., if w(t) for consequence j\\nof action i � 1, w(t) for all other consequences of action i must\\nbe 0).\\n\\nmomentary attractiveness\\n\\nthe momentary attractiveness (a) for each action is determined\\nby the motivational value of the consequence that is being attended\\nto at that moment. for example, the momentary attractiveness of\\nfocusing on research would be higher when the assistant professor\\nconsiders the possibility that she might get a publication, than\\nwhen she considers the possibility that she might not get a publi-\\ncation. the momentary attractiveness of focusing on teaching\\nwould be higher when the assistant professor considers the possi-\\nbility of receiving a good teaching rating, than when she considers\\nthe possibility of receiving a poor teaching evaluation. following\\ndft, the mgpm� defines momentary attractiveness as follows1:\\n\\nai�t� � �j wij(t) · mij(t). (6)\\naccording to the above equation, the momentary attractiveness\\n\\nof action i at time t is equal to the motivational value of the\\nconsequence that is being attended to at that time, because the\\n\\n1 the construct we refer to as momentary attractiveness is referred to as\\nvalence by decision field theory. we relabeled this construct because the\\nmgpm also includes a valence construct that is formally distinct from the\\nvalence construct in decision field theory.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n10 ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\nmomentary attention for that consequence will be equal to 1,\\nwhereas the momentary attention for other consequences will be\\nequal to 0.\\n\\npreference\\n\\nfollowing dft, the mgpm� assumes that preference (p)\\nchanges over time according to the following equation:\\n\\np(t) � p(t � 1) � [a1(t) � a2(t)]. (7)\\n\\nin our example, a1(t) represents the momentary attractiveness of\\nprioritizing research and a2(t) represents the momentary attrac-\\ntiveness of prioritizing teaching. positive values of preference\\ntherefore indicate that prioritizing research is preferred, whereas\\nnegative values indicate that prioritizing teaching is preferred. the\\np(t � 1) term in the equation means that preference is a variable\\nwith memory (i.e., it is a dynamic variable; vancouver ,\\n2010). it moves from its last value based on the differences in the\\nactions’ momentary attractiveness at a given point in time.\\n\\nsimulation of the mgpm�\\n\\nin this section, wnerate predictions for the mgpm� by\\nconducting a simulation study (kozlowski, chao, grand, braun, &\\nkuljanin, 2013). in this study, we simulate the model under dif-\\nferent conditions and examine the emnt behavior of the model\\nin each one. the results of the simulation represent the model’s\\npredictions. we test those predictions in an empirical study de-\\nscribed in the next section.\\n\\nwe constructed the simulation study to address three specific\\nresearch questions. each research question corresponds to an aim\\nof the paper. the first research question relates to how prioritiza-\\ntion is influenced by avoidancals:\\n\\nrq1: how does prioritization differ when pursuing two ap-\\nproach goals, two avoidancals, or one approach and one\\navoidancal?\\n\\nthe second research question relates to the complexity of pri-\\noritization decisions. the decision we examine in this paper is one\\nwhere actions can involve risk. we examine prioritization as a\\nfunction of whether the outcomes of actions are risky or certain.\\nby risky, we mean that actions have more than one possible\\nconsequence, but that the person knows the probability that each\\nconsequence will occur. by certain, we mean that each action has\\none consequence that is guaranteed to occur. the second research\\nquestion is as follows:\\n\\nrq2: how does prioritization differ when actions are risky\\ncompared with when actions are certain?\\n\\nthe third research question relates to the model’s ability to\\naccount for prioritization strategies. we argue that differences in\\nstrategy can be accounted for by the time sensitivity parameter in\\nthe model (�). a high level of time sensitivity makes people more\\nattuned to the likelihood that each goal can be achieved. as a result\\nof this increased sensitivity, people should be more likely to make\\nprioritization decisions based on expectancy. thus, high levels of\\ntime sensitivity should make people more likely to work on the\\ngoal that has theatest likelihood of attainment at any point in\\n\\ntime, and therefore more likely to display the sequential strategy.\\nthis means that when pursuing approach goals, people should be\\nmore likely to prioritize thal with the smallest discrepancy, and\\nwhen pursuing avoidancals, people should be more likely to\\nprioritize thal with the largest discrepancy. a low level of time\\nsensitivity makes people less attuned to the likelihood that each\\ngoal can be achieved. as a result, people should be less likely to\\nmake prioritization decisions based on expectancy. thus, low\\nlevels of time sensitivity should make people more likely to work\\non thal that has the highest valence at any point in time and to\\ndisplay the concurrent strategy. therefore, the third research ques-\\ntion is:\\n\\nrq3: how does the time sensitivity parameter influence pri-\\noritization strategy?\\n\\nsimulation method description\\n\\nwe created a simulation study that mirrored the task that we\\nused in the experiment described subsequently to validate the\\nmodel’s predictions. this experimental task required the partici-\\npant to make a series of prioritization decisions while pursuing two\\ngoals (referred to as goal a and goal b). participants were assigned\\none approach and one avoidancal (henceforth, ‘approach–\\navoidance’), two approach goals (‘approach–approach’), or two\\navoidancals (‘avoidance–avoidance’). the task required partici-\\npants to make a series of choices between two actions. each action\\nprioritized onal at the expense of the other, for example, by\\nproviding the opportunity to make progress toward onal, while\\nmissing out on the opportunity to make progress toward the other. we\\nvaried the level of risk associated with the actions. in the risky\\ncondition, the action had two possible consequences, with an equal\\nprobability of occurring if the action was selected. in the certain\\ncondition, the action had one certain consequence if the action was\\nselected.\\n\\nsimulating a computational model typically involves fixing the\\nparameters to specific values (see table 4). the choice of these\\nvalues can be important because the parameters influence the\\nbehavior of the simulation. if parameters are fixed to values that\\nare not observed in the population of interest, the behavior of the\\nsimulation may not reflect the process under investigation. fortu-\\nnately, some parameter values can be selected based on the fact\\nthat they are reasonablven the task environment. this was the\\n\\ntable 4\\nparameter values specified for the model simulation\\n\\nparameter description

mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\ncase for the valence intercept, gain, expected lag, and attention\\nwt parameters. we fixed the valence intercept to 0 for ap-\\nproach and 5 for avoidance, and thin parameter to 1 for\\napproach goals and �1 for avoidancals. these values were\\nreasonable because they ensured that the overall level of valence\\nwould be approximately equal for approach and avoidancals.\\nwe fixed the expected lag to 2. this value was reasonable because\\non average it would take two units of time to reduce each discrep-\\nancy by one unit in this task. we fixed the attention wts to\\nequal the objective probabilities of the consequences, which was\\nreasonable because dft predicts that the probability of attending\\nto a consequence relates to the probability of that consequence\\noccurring.\\n\\nin contrast to the above parameters, we did not have a priori\\nestimates of time sensitivity and threshold, because these values\\nvary across individuals. we therefore simulated a range of values\\nfor these parameters to ensure the simulation results were robust.\\na common method for ensuring robust results is to run multiple\\nsimulations where parameter values are sampled randomly from a\\ndistribution that reflects the variability of that parameter in the\\npopulation of interest (i.e., monte carlo). the results can be\\ncollapsed across simulations to illustrate the behavior that is most\\nlikely to occur in that population. we used this method to generate\\ntime sensitivity and threshold parameters. we identified the dis-\\ntribution of these parameters by fitting the mgpm� to data from a\\nprevious study of multiplal pursuit (ballard, yeo, vancouver,\\n& neal, 2013) where the parameters for each participant were\\nestimated. in the previous study, the time sensitivity parameter had\\na mean of 0.33 and a standard deviation of 0.25. the threshold\\nparameter had a mean of 0.71 and a standard deviation of 0.34. we\\nused these values to generate the sampling distributions for each\\nparameter in the simulation study (with the constraint that neither\\nparameter could have a negative value).\\n\\nwe ran one million simulations in matlab for each goal type\\n(approach–approach, avoidance–avoidance, or approach–avoidance)\\ncrossed with risk combination (risky vs. certain). each simulation\\nincluded 10 decisions. the model predicted the probability of\\nselecting the action that prioritized goal a. we simulated the\\nactual decision by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution\\nwith a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1. if the sampled value\\nwas less than the predicted probability of prioritizing goal a, the\\nmodel prioritized goal a, if not, the model prioritized goal b. the\\ndependent variable of interest was the action selected, because this\\nindicated which goal was being prioritized. this method ensured\\nthat, over a large number of observations, the proportion of times\\nthe model selected the action that prioritized goal a would match\\nthe predicted probability of prioritizing goal a (and vice versa for\\ngoal b).\\n\\nwe examined research questions 1 and 2 by examining how the\\nlikelihood of an action being selected (and thus a particular goal\\nbeing prioritized) varied according to thal type and risk ma-\\nnipulations. we examined research question 3 by examining how\\nthe likelihood of selecting an action differed depending on the\\nvalue of the time sensitivity parameter. to do this, wouped the\\nsimulations according to the time sensitivity parameter value.\\nsimulations were classified as very low time sensitivity if the value\\nof the time sensitivity parameter was below the 25th percentile,\\nlow time sensitivity if the value was between the 25th and 50th\\npercentiles, high time sensitivity if the value was between the 50th\\n\\nand 75th percentiles, and very high time sensitivity if the value was\\nabove the 75th percentile. we examined the simulation results for\\nthese four groups separately.\\n\\nsimulation results and discussion\\n\\nprevious research on multiple-approach–goal pursuit has plot-\\nted prioritization effects as a function of relative discrepancy. for\\nexample, schmidt and deshon (2007) plotted prioritization as a\\nfunction of whether a goal’s discrepancy was larger than, equal to,\\nor smaller than, the discrepancy for the other goal. we do the same\\nfor the approach–approach and avoidance–avoidance conditions.\\nfor the approach–avoidance condition, we plot the predictions as\\na function of the time (represented as decision number). discrepancy has\\nopposing effects for approach and avoidancals and, as a result,\\nthese effects cannot be interpreted if the data are plotted as a\\nfunction of relative discrepancy.\\n\\nthe simulation results revealed that goal type, risk, and time\\nsensitivity had an interactive influence on prioritization (see fig-\\nures 5, 6, and 7). to simplify the presentation of this interaction,\\nwe present the results in two stages. we first present the results for\\nthe approach–avoidance condition. we then present the results for\\nthe approach–approach and avoidance–avoidance conditions.\\n\\napproach–avoidance\\n\\nfigure 5 shows the proportion of times the model selected the\\naction that prioritized the approach goal as a function of the time,\\nrisk, and individual differences in time sensitivity. in general, the\\nmodel initially prioritized the approach goal. over time, however,\\npriority shifted from the approach goal to the avoidancal. this\\npattern emd because at the start of goal pursuit there was a\\nrelatively large distance to cover before either the desired or the\\nundesired state would be reached. in this situation, the valence of\\nacting on the approach goal is relatively high, whereas the valence\\nof acting on the avoidancal is relatively low. over time, as the\\nmodel got closer to the approach goal, the valence of acting on the\\napproach goal decreased. at the same time, the model also got\\ncloser to the avoidancal, because the avoidancal had not\\nbeen initially prioritized. the valence of acting on the avoidance\\ngoal therefore increased. this change in valence eventually caused\\nthe expected utility of acting on the avoidancal to exceed the\\nexpected utility of acting on the approach goal, prompting a shift\\nin priority.\\n\\nthe shift in priority from approach to avoidance also depended\\non risk. the effects of time were stronger when the consequences\\nof actions were certain than risky. when the consequences of\\nactions were certain, initial preference for the approach goal was\\nstronger and the shift from approach to avoidance more pro-\\nnounced than when the consequences were risky. this result\\nemd because attention is variable when actions are risky\\nbecause of the multiple possible consequences. however, attention\\nis less variable when actions are certain because there is only one\\nconsequence. the htened variability in attention when decid-\\ning between risky actions made the choices at a given point in time\\nless predictable.\\n\\nfinally, time sensitivity had only a weak influence on prioriti-\\nzation. when actions were risky there was virtually no difference\\nin prioritization as a function of time sensitivity. when

ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\nwere certain time sensitivity appeared to influence the timing of\\nthe shift in priority from approach to avoidance. when time\\nsensitivity was lower, the switch in priority from approach to\\navoidance occurred earlier; when time sensitivity was higher, the\\nswitch in priority occurred later. this result emd because\\nlower levels of time sensitivity represent less sensitivity to the\\ndeadline, which increases the likelihood of switching priority\\nbefore the approach goal is achieved.\\n\\napproach–approach and avoidance–avoidance\\n\\nfor the conditions in which both goals are of the same type, we\\nrefer to each goal as simply goal a or goal b. figures 6 and 7\\nshow the proportion of times the model selected the action that\\n\\nprioritized goal a as a function of risk, relative discrepancy, and\\ntime sensitivity when pursuing two approach goals (see figure 6)\\nor when pursuing two avoidancals (see figure 7). goal type\\nand time sensitivity both influenced the direction of the relation-\\nship between relative discrepancy and prioritization, whereas risk\\ninfluenced the strh of these

mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\nbetween goals as relative discrepancy changes. however, the\\nmodel produces behavior consistent with the sequential strategy\\nwhen time sensitivity is high, because it prioritizes thal\\nwith theatest likelihood of attainment, and it tends to\\nprioritize that goal until it is achieved.\\n\\nin the avoidance–avoidance condition, a different pattern\\nemd. the model most often prioritized thal with the\\nsmaller discrepancy at almost all levels of time sensitivity. this\\npattern is consistent with the concurrent strategy because it prior-\\nitizes thal with the lowest likelihood of achievement. the\\npattern held unless time sensitivity was very high and actions were\\ncertain. in this case, the model exhibited a weak tendency to\\nprioritize thal with the larger discrepancy. this difference in\\nthe predominance of each strategy between the approach–approach\\nand avoidance–avoidance conditions emd because expected\\nutility is more sensitive to differences in valence when valences\\nare lower. valence had a stronger effect in the avoidance–\\navoidance condition than in the approach–approach condition,\\nbecause valence is initially relatively low when pursuing avoid-\\nancals, but relatively high when pursuing approach goals. as\\na result, the model was more likely to prioritize thal that was\\nworse off in the avoidance–avoidance condition than in the\\napproach–approach condition.\\n\\nfinally, risk influenced the strh of these relationships. the\\ninteraction between goal type, relative discrepancy, and time sen-\\nsitivity was stronger when actions were certain compared with\\nwhen they were risky. once again, this effect was attributable to\\nthe htened variability in attention when actions were risky\\ncompared with when actions were certain. because of this ht-\\nened variability in attention, choices were less predictable when\\nactions were risky.\\n\\nempirical test of the mgpm�\\n\\nhaving generated predictions for the mgpm� regarding the\\neffects of goal type, risk, and time sensitivity on prioritization, we\\n\\nnow test those predictions empirically. we made several hypoth-\\neses based on the simulation results. we begin with hypotheses for\\nthe approach–avoidance condition. in this condition, we focus\\non the effects of time and risk, because the simulation study\\nrevealed that these are the strongest predictors of prioritization. we\\nmade the following hypotheses:\\n\\nh1: when pursuing one approach and one avoidancal,\\npeople will shift priority over time from the approach to the\\navoidancal.\\n\\nh2: the shift in priority over time from the approach to the\\navoidancal will be more pronounced when actions are\\ncertain than when they are risky.\\n\\nwe also made hypotheses for the approach–approach condition.\\nin this condition, we focus on the effects of relative discrepancy,\\nrisk, and time sensitivity, because the simulation study revealed\\nthat all three are strong predictors of prioritization. we made the\\nfollowing hypotheses:\\n\\nh3: when pursuing two approach goals, people with lower\\ntime sensitivity will be more likely to prioritize thal with\\nthe larger discrepancy (i.e., the concurrent strategy), whereas\\npeople with higher time sensitivity will be more likely to\\nprioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy (i.e., the se-\\nquential strategy).\\n\\nh4: the two-way interaction between relative discrepancy\\nand time sensitivity described in h3 will be stronger when\\nactions are certain than when they are risky.\\n\\nfinally, we made hypotheses for the avoidance–avoidance con-\\ndition. in this condition, time sensitivity influenced the magnitude\\nof the effect of relative discrepancy, but not the

mgpm�\\n\\nare supported, we also examine whether the empirical results can\\nbe accounted for by the original mgpm. demonstrating that the\\nmgpm� provides a better account of the data than the previous\\nmodel is important because the increased complexity of the\\nmgpm� can only be justified if the model has superior explana-\\ntory power. thus, if the mgpm� does not provide a better account\\nof the data, the original mgpm should be preferred on thounds\\nof parsimony. we therefore systematically compare the mgpm�’s\\nability to explain the empirical results to the mgpm. we also\\ncompare the mgpm� to two other alternatives to justify the\\nintegration of dft and the introduction of the valence intercept.\\n\\nour aim was to (a) extend the mgpm to provide a more sophis-\\nticated explanation that accounts for the complex choice problems\\nencountered during multiplal pursuit, (b) enable the model to\\naccount for avoidancals, and (c) demonstrate that the model can\\naccount for individual differences in prioritization strategy. the\\nextended model, the mgpm�, is an integration of the original\\nmgpm (vancouver , 2010) and dft (busemeyer ,\\n2006; busemeyer & townsend, 1993) that explains how people\\nprioritize when pursuing different combinations of approach or\\navoidancals where actions involve risk or uncertainty and\\nwhen actions can impact progress for more than onal. in a\\nsimulation study, we demonstrated that the mgpm� predicts dif-\\nferences in prioritization as a function of goal type, risk, and time\\nsensitivity.\\n\\nthe predictions of the mgpm� corresponded with the behavior\\nobserved. as predicted, individuals who pursued one approach and\\none avoidancal tended to switch priority from the approach\\ngoal to the avoidancal over time. among those pursuing two\\napproach goals, time sensitivity interacted with relative discrep-\\nancy in the manner that was predicted. participants with a low\\nvalue for the time sensitivity parameter tended to prioritize the\\ngoal with the larger discrepancy, which is consistent with the\\nconcurrent strategy. participants with a high value for the time\\nsensitivity parameter tended to prioritize thal with the smaller\\ndiscrepancy, which is consistent with the sequential strategy, but\\nonly tended to do so when both actions were certain. everyone\\nwho pursued two avoidancals tended to display the concurrent\\nstrategy by prioritizing thal with the smaller discrepancy. as\\npredicted, these effects were stronger when the consequences of\\nboth actions were certain, compared to when one or more of the\\nactions were risky, except in the case of those pursuing two\\navoidancals. we also showed that the mgpm� provided a\\nbetter account of participants’ prioritization decisions than the\\noriginal mgpm and that the major extensions to the model could\\nbe justified. in the following sections, we discuss the theoretical,\\nempirical, and practical contributions of this paper, highlight po-\\ntential limitations, and suggest avenues for further research.\\n\\ncontributions to the multiplal pursuit literature\\n\\nthe mgpm� generalized the original mgpm to include avoid-\\nancals. moreover, it generated novel predictions that, in

ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\neral, were supported by the data. the predictions regarding goal\\ntype conv on the notion that, if expectancy is held constant,\\npeople are more likely to prioritize thal with the higher\\nvalence. the model assumes that valence decreases as you get\\ncloser to a desired state (i.e., an approach goal), but increases as\\nyou get closer to an undesired state (i.e., an avoidancal). as a\\nresult, people simultaneously pursuing one approach and one\\navoidancal tended to prioritize the approach goal earlier and\\nthe avoidancal later. the prediction emd because the\\nvalence, and therefore the expected utility of acting on the avoid-\\nancal, is lower when thal is further away, and is therefore\\noutwed by the expected utility of acting on the approach goal.\\nit is important to note that the nature of the approach-to-avoidance\\npriority shift may differ when the initial states for thals differ.\\nfor example, if the initial state for the avoidancal was closer\\nto the undesired state, the priority shift may occur earlier (or not at\\nall), because the expected utility of acting on the avoidancal\\nwould be higher.\\n\\nthe mgpm�’s prediction regarding risk is that the tendency to\\nprioritize a particular goal should be stronger when actions have\\nmore certain consequences. this prediction is a direct consequence\\nof incorporating dft into the mgpm� (busemeyer & townsend,\\n1993). according to dft, people pay attention to the most likely\\nconsequences of their actions. as risk levels increase, people pay\\nmore attention to a range of different consequences. this creates\\nmore variability in preferences over time, which weakens the\\neffect of a goal’s expected utility. as a result, people make noisier\\ndecisions. seu theory cannot account for this tendency for deci-\\nsions to become noisier as variability in possible consequences\\nincreases (busemeyer, 1985). we observed this effect of risk in the\\napproach–avoidance and approach–approach conditions. indeed,\\nfor participants in the approach–approach condition with higher\\ntime sensitivity parameter values, the effect of relative discrepancy\\ndisappeared when one or more action did not have certain conse-\\nquences. these findings provide strong support for replacing the\\nchoice function in the original mgpm with the sequential sam-\\npling process described by dft when predicting complex choices.\\n\\nalthough the predictions of the mgpm� were largely supported,\\nwe did not find the expected effect of risk in the avoidance–\\navoidance condition. in this condition, people demonstrated a\\nconsistent tendency to prioritize thal with the smaller discrep-\\nancy regardless of risk. as a result, the model did not provide as\\nclose a fit to the data when participants were pursuing two avoid-\\nancals and actions were risky, as it did in other conditions.\\nfurthermore, although the model correctly predicted the direction\\nof the effect of risk in the approach–avoidance condition, it over-\\nestimated the strh of the effect. the shift in priority from\\napproach to avoidance over time was stronger than predicted by\\nthe model when both actions were risky. these findings illustrate\\nthe value of using formal models, because it is clear when a model\\ncannot account for the direction or strh of effects observed in\\nthe data. one explanation for the lack of an effect of risk in the\\navoidance–avoidance condition is that people focus their attention\\nmore narrowly in the presence of avoidancals (förster, fried-\\nman, özelsel, & denzler, 2006; friedman & förster, 2005). al-\\nlocating attention in this way would mean that attention fluctuates\\nless when actions have multiple possible consequences, and would\\ntherefore weaken the effect of risk. the mgpm� might account for\\nthis by assuming that, when avoidancals are present, attention\\n\\nis not necessarily allocated in line with the objective probability of\\nthe possible consequences.\\n\\nfinally, the mgpm� provides a formal explanation for individ-\\nual differences in prioritization strategy. we observed a mix of\\nbehavioral patterns among participants pursuing two approach\\ngoals, with some participants displaying the concurrent strategy\\nand others displaying the sequential strategy. individual differ-\\nences in strategy were reflected in the time sensitivity parameter.\\naccording to the mgpm�, when time sensitivity is higher, people\\nare more likely to make prioritization decisions based on expec-\\ntancy. as a result, people will tend to display a sequential strategy:\\nthey will generally work on thal with theatest likelihood\\nof attainment and continue to do so until that goal is sufficiently\\nclose to achievement. when time sensitivity is lower, people are\\nless likely to make prioritization decisions based on expectancy.\\nas a result, people will tend to display a concurrent strategy by\\nworking on thal with the highest valence, and switch priority\\nbetween goals as relative position changes.\\n\\ngoal framing versus incentive framing\\n\\nin the experiment presented here, we used incentives to rein-\\nforce the desirability of the approach goals and the undesirability\\nof the avoidancals. it is therefore reasonable to ask whether the\\neffect of the manipulation of goal type was due to the framing of\\nthals or the framing of the incentives. however, if our results\\nwere attributable to incentive framing, then the original mgpm\\nshould be able to account for the effect of the experimental\\nmanipulation. this is because the original mgpm assumes that\\nincentives influencal importance (and therefore prioritization)\\nvia thin parameter. our model comparisons revealed that the\\noriginal mgpm did not explain participants’ decisions as well as\\nthe mgpm�. we also examined an alternative model (alternative\\n2), which was identical to the mgpm� except that it did not\\ncontain the valence intercept—the extension to the valence func-\\ntion that we argued was required to account for the effect of goal\\ntype. this alternative model could not account for the effect of the\\nexperimental manipulation either. furthermore, the results of the\\ncurrent study are consistent with an unpublished study that ma-\\nnipulated only goal framing (ballard , 2013). this study\\nreplicated the finding that people pursuing two avoidancals\\ntend to prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy, and people\\npursuing an approach and avoidancal tend to shift priority over\\ntime from the approach to the avoidancal.3 collectively, these\\nfindings suggest that the effect of thal type manipulation\\nobserved in the current study was not simply due to incentive\\nframing.\\n\\nnevertheless, we still view incentive framing as an important\\navenue for future research. it would be useful to manipulatal\\nframing and incentive framing independently to examine their\\ninteraction. such a manipulation was not feasible in our study\\nbecause of the complex design (our goal type � risk manipulation\\nhad 16 unique combinations). however, it would be possible to\\nexamine thal frame � incentive frame interaction without\\nmanipulating risk. we predict that incentive frame should influ-\\nence the strh of the effect of relative discrepancy, and that the\\nmgpm� will account for the effect using thin parameter.\\n\\n3 details available from the

mgpm�\\n\\n\\n\\nschmidt and deshon (2007) showed that people pursuing two\\napproach goals showed a stronger tendency to prioritize thal in\\nthe worse position when incentives were framed as losses com-\\npared to gains. they argued that the effect of relative discrepancy\\nwas stronger in the former context because of loss aversion (kah-\\nneman & tversky, 1979)—people are more sensitive to potential\\nlosses than gains of equivalent magnitude. if so, then gain should\\nbe stronger when goals have incentives that are framed as losses,\\nregardless of whether thal is approach or avoidance (vancou-\\nver , 2010).\\n\\npractical applications\\n\\nthere are a number of potential applications of the findings of\\nthis study in situations that require individuals to manage multiple\\ngoals. the finding that people shift priority from approach to\\navoidancals over time may be particularly important in safety\\ncritical industries, such as mining, aviation, or medicine, where\\npeople have to effectively manage safety and productivity goals.\\nproductivity is typically framed as an approach goal, whereas\\nsafety is typically framed as an avoidancal (, ensuring that\\nthe number of incidents does not exceed a specified level over a\\ngiven period). our results suggest that framing productivity and\\nsafety goals in this manner may lead people to prioritize produc-\\ntivity over safety. one way to encourage people to prioritize safety\\nmay be to frame safety as an approach goal. this is consistent with\\na growing interest in the safety literature on promoting behaviors\\nthat make the work environment safe, rather than preventing\\nbehaviors that make it unsafe (neal & griffin, 2006). in aviation,\\nfor example, there has been a shift away from ‘conflict detection\\nand avoidance,’ which is an avoidancal, toward ‘separation\\nassurance,’ which is an approach goal (durso & manning, 2009;\\nloft, bolland, humphreys & neal, 2009).\\n\\nthe current study provides insight into different ways to influ-\\nence how individuals or teams allocate resources when managing\\nmultiple tasks. there are many situations in which people need to\\nprioritize the allocation of resources. common examples include\\nproject management and task scheduling. under some circum-\\nstances, the best strategy is to prioritize the task with theater\\namount of work required because it ensures that progress is made\\non both. under other circumstances, the best strategy is to focus on\\nthe task with the least amount of work required, to ensure that at\\nleast one task is completed by the deadline (ballard, yeo, neal, &\\nfarrell, 2016). our findings suggest that these choices are sensitive\\nto the way that thals are framed and the level of uncertainty\\nthat employees have regarding the potential consequences of their\\nactions. for example, if a manager wants employees to use the\\nconcurrent strategy, it would make sense to frame thals in\\navoidance terms and to enhance the level of certainty regarding the\\nconsequences of actions. for example, certainty may be enhanced\\nby reducing the number of distractions in the work environment or\\nallocating particular times to work exclusively on that task. how-\\never, in many cases, uncertainty will be unavoidable. our results\\nimply that people will not show strong preferences for one strategy\\nover the other when there is a high level of uncertainty. this may\\nwell be adaptive because it means that people are more flexible in\\nthe way they prioritizals in an uncertain environment (hannah\\n& neal, 2014).\\n\\nthe lack of variability in strategy in the avoidance–avoidance\\ncontext is interesting from a practical perspective because it im-\\nplies that conflict between avoidancals creates a psychologi-\\ncally “strong” environment that limits the potential for individual\\ndifferences to be expressed (sydner & ickes, 1985). this finding\\nhas implications for understanding how managers can use different\\ntypes of goals to enhance team performance. strong situations can\\nenhance cooperation because they provide clear behavioral norms\\n(de kwaadsteniet, van dijk, wit, & de cremer, 2006). however,\\ntoo much homogeneity among team members can lead to poor\\ngroup decision making (olson, parayitam, & bao, 2007). in the\\nend, goal framing may not provide a one-size-fits-all solution for\\noptimizing strategies among individuals and teams. however, our\\nresults highlight the need for managers to be aware of the impli-\\ncations that goal frame has on strategy.\\n\\nadditional considerations and avenues for\\nfuture research\\n\\none issue that should be considered is the assumption that the\\nsubjective immediate value (i.e., valence) of acting on a goal is\\nalways a linear function of the discrepancy. both the mgpm and\\ndft share this assumption and are able to account for a broad\\nrange of empirical phenomena (busemeyer , 2006; vancouver\\n, 2010, 2014). however, this assumption may not always\\nhold. for example, if the assistant professor is told that she will\\nlose her job if she does not publish 10 papers before her tenure\\ndeadline, the valence of publishing her tenth paper could be just as\\nhigh as the valence of publishing her first. in this case, valence\\nmay be more accurately described as a step-function that drops\\nonly after the tenth paper is published. alternatively, heath, lar-\\nrick and wu (1999) have made arguments that suggest the valence\\nfunction may be nonlinear, following the form described by pros-\\npect theory (kahneman & tversky, 1979).\\n\\nit is worth noting that the mgpm� cannot explain how well or\\nhow poorly people make decisions during multiplal pursuit.\\nthis type of examination requires evaluating people’s decisions\\nagainst a normative model (baron, 2004, 2012). recent work has\\nextended a normative model of decision making to the multiple-\\ngoal pursuit context and found that people depart from optimal\\nprioritization in systematic ways depending on whether they are\\npursuing approach or avoidancals (ballard , 2016). by\\ncomparing the mgpm�’s predictions to this type of normative model,\\nit would be possible to assess the extent to which the mgpm�\\n\\npredicts departures from optimality. in doing so, future work may\\nbe able to use the mgpm� to explain why people exhibit biases in\\ndecision making during multiplal pursuit.\\n\\napplicability of the mgpm�\\n\\nthe mgpm� can be applied to different types of multiplal\\nenvironments. in some cases, goals are directly in conflict with\\neach other such that progress toward onal precludes the\\npossibility of progress toward another goal. in other cases, it is\\npossible to make progress toward both goals at the same time. in\\nthis experiment, we assumed that a person could make progress\\ntoward an approach goal if this goal was prioritized, but could not\\nmake progress towards thal that was not prioritized. likewise,\\nthe person could prevent themselves from moving toward an\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\ndo\\n\\ncu\\nm\\n\\nen\\nt\\n\\nis\\nco\\n\\npy\\nri\\n\\ngh\\nte\\n\\nd\\nby\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\na\\nm\\n\\ner\\nic\\n\\nan\\nps\\n\\nyc\\nho\\n\\nlo\\ngi\\n\\nca\\nl\\n\\na\\nss\\n\\noc\\nia\\n\\ntio\\nn\\n\\nor\\non\\n\\ne\\nof\\n\\nits\\nal\\n\\nlie\\nd\\n\\npu\\nbl\\n\\nis\\nhe\\n\\nrs\\n.\\n\\nt\\nhi\\n\\ns\\nar\\n\\ntic\\nle\\n\\nis\\nin\\n\\nte\\nnd\\n\\ned\\nso\\n\\nle\\nly\\n\\nfo\\nr\\n\\nth\\ne\\n\\npe\\nrs\\n\\non\\nal\\n\\nus\\ne\\n\\nof\\nth\\n\\ne\\nin\\n\\ndi\\nvi\\n\\ndu\\nal\\n\\nus\\ner\\n\\nan\\nd\\n\\nis\\nno\\n\\nt\\nto\\n\\nbe\\ndi\\n\\nss\\nem\\n\\nin\\nat\\n\\ned\\nbr\\n\\noa\\ndl\\n\\ny.\\n\\n22 ballard, yeo, loft, vancouver, and neal\\n\\n\\n\\navoidancal if the avoidancal was prioritized, but was\\nguaranteed to move closer to it if thal was not prioritized.\\nhowever, the mgpm� can also be applied to environments in\\nwhich actions may simultaneously benefit multiplals or when\\nthe probabilities of making progress toward goals are different.\\nresearch has shown that the effects that em in these types of\\nenvironments are similar to the ones observed in the experiment\\npresented above. ballard  (2013) compared prioritization\\npatterns in environments in which actions could simultaneously\\nbenefit both goals versus when they could only benefit onal at\\na time, and found few differences between the two environments.\\nfurthermore, the qualitative pattern of prioritization when actions\\nhad an 80% chance of benefitting a goal was similar to the pattern\\nwhen actions only had a 50% chance.\\n\\nalthough we only examined prioritization involving two goals,\\nthe model can be applied to any number of goals. the mgpm� can\\nalso bneralized to choices involving more than two actions in\\nthe same way as dft (see roe , 2001)—by assuming that the\\npreference state for each action undes a separate accumulation\\nprocess, and that preference for one action suppresses preference\\nfor the other actions. in this way, the mgpm� can account for the\\nfact that people take longer to decide between three or more\\nactions than they do to decide between two (busemeyer & died-\\nerich, 2002; onken, hastie, & revelle, 1985). the mgpm� can\\nalso bneralized to decisions involving uncertainty, rather than\\nrisk, by assuming that attention wts change as people learn the\\nlikelihood of different consequences. moreover, we only examined\\nan environment in which disturbances affected the consequence of\\nan action. however, there are other types of disturbances. the\\nmgpm� can bneralized to situations in which disturbances\\nmay affect the time it takes for the consequence of an action to\\nbecome apparent, or alter the state of the variable being controlled\\nin the absence of any action being carried out (vancouver ,\\n2014).\\n\\nit is important to recognize that some of the parameters included\\nin the original mgpm and dft were not addressed in this paper.\\nall of the parameters from each theory are relevant to the mgpm�\\n\\nand are important for understanding decision making during\\nmultiplal pursuit mornerally. for parsimony, however, we\\nfocused this paper on parameters that we believed were most\\nimportant to understanding the effects of approach–avoidance\\nframing and risk on prioritization. here we discuss additional\\nparameters and provide suggestions for how they might be incor-\\nporated in future research.\\n\\nfor example, the original mgpm includes an expected lag bias\\nparameter that represents individuals’ beliefs regarding the rate of\\nprogress that can be achieved when working toward a goal. this\\nparameter is potentially important for understanding a source of\\noptimism or pessimism in expectancy. the model presented in this\\npaper assumed that, when someone is completely ignorant of the\\ndifference between the time available and the expected time re-\\nquired to reach thal (i.e., when � � 0), expectancy would\\nalways equal 0.5. however, incorporation of the bias parameter\\nwould explain how a person who is optimistic about the achievable\\nrate of progress might have an expectancy of greater than 0.5, or\\nhow a pessimistic person might have an expectancy of less than\\n0.5.\\n\\ndft includes self-feedback parameters that produce a return to\\nbaseline phenomenon in which memory for preferences decays\\n\\nover time (i.e., ‘leaky’ accumulation). it also includes lateral\\ninhibition parameters that produce ‘suppression,’ whereby prefer-\\nence for one action is inhibited by preference for another action.\\nthese parameters are particularly relevant for understanding\\nchoices involving more than two actions (i.e., roe , 2001).\\nbusemeyer and townsend (1993) also introduce an approach–\\navoidancadient parameter. this parameter enables the model to\\naccount for the fact that people take longer to decide between\\nactions with undesirable consequences than they do to decide\\nbetween actions with desirable consequences (busemeyer &\\ntownsend, 1993; houston , 1991). we did not address this\\nparameter because it has little effect on choice probabilities (see\\nfigure 9 in busemeyer & townsend, 1993). however, this param-\\neter will be important for future research seeking to model the\\nrelationship between goal framing and the time it takes to make a\\nprioritization decision.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nthe mgpm� represents a step forward in the development of a\\nformal, unified theory of multiplal pursuit. we demonstrated\\nthat the mgpm� can explain how people make prioritization\\ndecisions when pursuing different combinations of approach and\\navoidancals, and when the consequences of actions vary in\\ntheir level of risk. we hope that the mgpm� will be used as a\\nfoundation for continued development of a general theory of\\nmotivation and decision making that explains the importance of\\ngoals in navigating the complexity and uncertainty of one’s envi-\\nronment, and, in doing so, helps to build a stronger bridge between\\nbasic psychological science and organization studies.\\n'"

of western australia jeffrey. vancouver ohio university andrew neal university of queensland we develop and test an integrative formal model of motivation and decision making. the model referred to as the extended multiplal pursuit model is an integration of the multiplal pursuit model and decision field theory. simulations of the model generated predictions regarding the effects of goal type risk and time sensitivity on prioritization. we tested these predictions in an experiment in which participants pursued different combinations of approach and avoidancals under different levels of risk. the empirical results were consistent with the predictions of the mgpm. specifically participants pursuing approach and avoidancal shifted priority from the approach to the avoidance goal over time. among participants pursuing approach goals those with low time sensitivity prioritized thal with the larger discrepancy whereas those with high time sensitivity prioritized thal with the smaller discrepancy. participants pursuing avoidancals generally prioritized thal with the smaller discrepancy. finally all of these effects became weaker as the level of risk increased. we used quantitative model comparison to show that the mgpm explained the data better than the original multiplal pursuit model and that the major extensions from the original model were justified. the mgpm represents step forward in the development of general theory of decision making during multiplal pursuit. keywords approach avoidance computational modeling decision making multiplal pursuit risk people often pursue multiple competing goals striving to achieve desired outcomes while avoiding undesired outcomes. because individuals have limited time and resources they often have to choose which goal to prioritize at any given moment. these choices are difficult because progress toward onal may come at the expense of progress toward others. consider an assistant professor striving to publish sufficient number of papers before her tenure deadline while simultaneously ensuring that she does not obtain poor teaching ratings. if she prioritizes her research over the summer it might lead to publication but it may also increase her risk of receiving poor teaching rating in the subsequent semester. by contrast if she prioritizes teaching she may be able to avoid poor teaching rating but would reduce her chances of obtaining publication. the choice involves risk because single action can have number of potential consequences. the processes by which people make decisions in these types of dynamic and uncertain environments are poorly understood. until recently the field lacked formal theory that explains the process by which people make decisions in the face of competing goals. formal theories are needed because their descriptions of psychological phenomena are more precise than verbal theories. they provide mathematical representation of the hypothetical processes thought to be responsible for observed phenomena. moreover formal theories are capable of generating falsifiable predictions which enable the field to make cumulative progress. vancouver weinhardt and schmidt took the initial steps toward formal theory of multiplegoal pursuit by developing the multiplal pursuit model which is cognitive model of approach goal striving. the model integrates control theory accounts of self-regulation and classic subjective expected utility accounts of decision making yeo zacher vancouver and schmidt. we thank diana tan and lisa jooste for their assistance in running the experiment. correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to timothy ballard school of psychology university of queensland mcelwain building st. lucia qld australia.  au hi do cu en is co

effects observed in existing empirical studies of multiplal pursuit including the effects of incentives and the tendency for people to switch priority from the goal with more progress needed to attain thal to one with less progress needed to attain thal as deadline approaches. the mgpm lays the foundation for developing general theory of multiplal pursuit. however it has only been applied to relatively simple choice problems in which each action has only one potential consequence. moreover the decision mechanism within the model is derived from subjective expected utility theory which has been superseded by more sophisticated theories of decision making. furthermore the model does not yet describe the mechanisms of avoidancal pursuit. avoidancals are internal representations of undesired states in contrast to approach goals which are internal representations of desired states. finally although there is range of strategies that people can use while pursuing multiplals the model predicts that most people will tend to work on thal in the worst position at any given point in time and therefore switch priority frequently. studies have shown that at least some people tend to work on thal in the best position and thus not switch priority until it has been achieved. the mgpm has not yet been used to account for the latter strategy. we address these issues by integrating the mgpm with decision field theory so that it provides more sophisticated explanation of the complex choices encountered during multiplal pursuit extending the mgpm to account for avoidancals and demonstrating that the model can account for individual differences in prioritization strategy. the resulting model which we call the mgpm explains the process by which people make complex choices involving risk or uncertainty while striving for approach and or avoidancals. to evaluate the model we first present simulation study in which we used the mgpm to generate set of predictions regarding the effects of goal type and risk on prioritization. we then test these predictions in an experiment. the empirical data from the experiment demonstrate that goal type and risk exert systematic effects on goal prioritization. we also show that the effects of these manipulations vary across individuals in way that is consistent with the predictions of the mgpm. further we demonstrate that the mgpm provides better account of the data than the original mgpm and that the major extensions of mgpm from the original model are justified. the multiplal pursuit model the mgpm is cognitive model based on control theory account of goal pursuit. control theory represents goal pursuit in terms of feedback control systems. thals that people pursue may be feature of the external world such as publishing certain number of papers to achieve tenure or internal to the person such as keeping emotions in check. according to control theory the tendency to act on goal is determined by the discrepancy between the perception of the current state of the variable being controlled and reference state for that variable. for example if our assistant professor has goal of publishing papers to obtain tenure and has published five to date the discrepancy is five. in the case of an approach goal the aim is to reach thal which eliminates the discrepancy. according to the mgpm the choice between competing goals is determined by comparing the subjective expected utilities of acting on each goal and then selecting thal with the highest expected utility. expected utility is label commonly used in the field of decision making. it represents the multiplicative combination of subjective sense of probability and subjective sense of value. these same concepts can be found in motivational theories such as expectancy theory although the labels for the constructs vary. for example utility is often referred to as valence or value in motivational theories. in the mgpm utility is referred to as valence. valence is the product of the discrepancy and gain which is the wt that represents the importance of thal to the individual. gain can be affected by internal and external factors such as the value or framing of incentives associated with obtaining thal. the other component of expected utility is expectancy which in the mgpm is derived by comparing subjective sense of the resources required to achieve thal and subjective sense of the resources available. the subjective sense of resources required is based on the discrepancy and belief regarding the resources it takes to reduce the discrepancy. this belief is developed with experience but is potentially biased as well. in the empirical protocols used to test the mgpm the resource was time and the availability of that resource was determined by deadline. because the discrepancy and the amount of resources available change over time the valence and expectancy of thal also change over time which means that they are dynamic. the mgpm predicts that as long as one perceives that there is sufficient time available to meet thals and thals importance are equal individuals will tend to prioritize thal with the larger discrepancy. however as the deadline approaches the model predicts that people will prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy because the perceived likelihood of achieving thal with the larger discrepancy will have decreased. in support of these predictions studies have demonstrated that people switch priority from thal with the largest discrepancy to the one with the smallest discrepancy as deadline looms though with preference for thal with the higher incentive if differential incentives exist. these studies also showed individual differences which the mgpm could account for via differences in the free parameters in the model. for example people who were more sensitive to the time available demonstrated an earlier preference reversal. more recently vancouver et al.  added learning component to the mgpm which explains how people learn to anticipate the effects of environmental disturbances on goal progress and form beliefs regarding resources needed to achieve thal. hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he rs. hi ar tic le is in te nd ed so le ly fo th pe rs on al us of th in di vi du al

extended to account for broader range of empirical phenomena. this process involves identifying the factors that limit the explanatory power of the model and modifying the model to address those factors often by integrating mechanisms from other psychological theories. this process of systematic integration and unification facilitates the cumulative development of knowl and is regarded as the hallmark of mature science. it also provides way of addressing the so-called replication crisis in psychology. the crisis is in part attributable to the fact that research is often not cumulative. emphasis tends to be on effects that are counterintuitive and chall conventional thinking rather than the systematic development and testing of theories that can account for the benchmark phenomena within field. in this paper we focus on different types of choices goals and strategies to broaden the range of phenomena the model can explain. types of choices the original mgpm has only been applied to relatively simple choice problems. in these choices each action has single known consequence. for example in the schmidt and deshon experimental paradigm participants had to create class schedules for students from two different colleges. there was line of students from each college and the participants had to create class schedules for every student in each line. when they completed schedule for student the number of students in line for that student college would always decrease by one reducing the discrepancy between the current state and goal state for the line. furthermore the original mgpm assumes that the person develops an expected utility based on the consequence of an action in relation to single goal. for example the model determines the expected utility of working on schedule for student from college based on the discrepancy for college. however choices often involve more than one potential consequence. furthermore these consequences often need to be considered in relation to more than onal. for example the assistant professor in our ongoing example cannot be certain that she will obtain publication if she prioritizes her research over the summer. she also needs to consider the possibility that prioritizing research may or may not lead to poor teaching rating and thus that the potential benefit for the research goal could come at the cost of the teaching goal. the mgpm needs more sophisticated decision mechanism to account for the types of complex choice problems described above. the decision mechanism within the original mgpm is derived from classic theories of decision making such as subjective expected utility theory and its derivatives such as expectancy theory. classic theories assume that people make decisions by comparing the expected utilities of various actions and selecting the action with the highest expected utility. an seu model provides reasonable first approximation for performance on relatively simple choice problems such as those to which the mgpm has been applied to date. however it is unlikely to account for performance on more complex problems. studies have consistently demonstrated that people violate many of the assumptions of seu theory and there is wide range of empirical phenomena for which seu theory and its derivatives cannot account. for example people do not always choose the option with the highest expected utility and preferences for options may reverse depending on time pressure or the method by which choices are elicited. furthermore choices are influenced not only by differences in expected utilities but also by the degree of uncertainty involved in decision. finally seu models assume that people make choices rationally by systematically assessing the likelihood and value of all the potential consequences of each action. however humans have limited information processing capacity and do not always fully consider the consequences of their actions. to provide more sophisticated explanation for the types of complex choices encountered during multiplal pursuit we extend the mgpm by integrating it with dft. dft was developed in response to the limitations of classic decision theories and is capable of accounting for behavior on complex choice problems such as those involving risk and uncertainty. this theory is member of class of decision models known as sequential sampling models. sequential sampling models provide dynamic cognitive explanation for how people make decisions. they describe how the preference for given course of action evolves over time as one considers the different consequences associated with each action. types of goals there are several different types of goals that people can pursue. one important distinction is between approach and avoidance goals. an approach goal is defined as desirable state individuals wish to reach whereas an avoidancal is defined as an undesirable state from which individuals wish to keep away. despite long history of research on approach and avoidance motivation surprisingly little research has examined the role of avoidancals in multiplal pursuit context. research that has focused on avoidancal pursuit has examined the causes and effects of avoidancal pursuit but has largely failed to consider how the process itself works. for example elliot and church hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation identifies antecedents and consequences of pursuing avoidance as compared to approach goals. other work focuses on understanding how personality influences whether people pursue approach or avoidancals. gable theory of approach and avoidance social motivation describes how dispositional motives and the features of one social environment influence the type of goals one pursues. although this work reveals factors that influencal adoption and outcomes associated with pursuing different types of goals it provides little insight into the factors that influence motivation or decision making during that pursuit. carver and scheier argue that different psychological processes are required for the pursuit of approach and avoidance goals. an important difference between approach and avoidance hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he rs. hi ar tic le is in te nd ed so le ly fo th pe rs on al us of th in di vi du al us er an is no to be di ss em in at ed br oa dl. the mgpm lies in the dynamics of valence. when pursuing approach goals valence should decrease as one moves closer to thal. however when pursuing avoidancals valence should increase as one moves closer to thal because thal is an undesired state. these arguments suggest that the decision-making architecture for approach and avoidancals may not be the same. we enable the mgpm to account for avoidancals by modifying the valence expectancy and expected utility functions within the original mgpm. strategies studies of multiplal pursuit have shown that there are individual differences in the way that people prioritizals. these studies have all used approach goals and have shown that some people tend to work on thal with the largest discrepancy at given point in time. in an approach context thal with the largest discrepancy is the one in the worst position because it is the furthest from attainment. the dynamic pattern that ems from this behavior is one in which the person switches back and forth between goals as the relative discrepancy changes. other people tend to work on thal that has the smallest discrepancy. the dynamic pattern that ems from this behavior is one in which the person works on onal until it has been or is close to being achieved. although the original mgpm has been used to explain the concurrent strategy it has not yet been used to account for the sequential strategy. in this paper we examine the different strategies people use when pursuing approach and avoidancals and assess whether the mgpm can account for each one. the results of our study show that there are individual differences in strategies among people pursuing approach goals but not among people pursuing avoidancals and that the mgpm can account for these effects. decision field theory to enable the mgpm to account for the more complex choice problems encountered during multiplal pursuit we integrate the mgpm with dft. dft is sequential sampling model developed to explain the mechanisms involved in decision making under risk and uncertainty. the theory is capable of accounting for wide range of empirical phenomena that could not be explained by any one previous theory including violations of stochastic dominance violations of independence between alternatives the relationship between choice probability and decision time the effects of time pressure on choice accuracy and the effects of changes in risk or uncertainty on choice probability. there are several reasons why dft is the ideal candidate for integration with the mgpm. first dft is formal dynamic model of decision making that describes how goals influence decision making. like the mgpm it assumes that the subjective value of acting on goal changes as the person makes progress toward or away from that goal. this makes dft amenable to integration with the mgpm because they share the same basic assumptions. second it pro vides general account of decision making involving any number of goals actions and consequences whereas the original mgpm only addresses choices between two actions where each action only affects onal. thus dft enables the mgpm to generalize to more complex situations than the mgpm. third dft was developed to explain how people make choices involving risk or uncertainty which is one type of complex choice problem we seek to understand in this paper. finally dft provides an explanation of the internal dynamics of the decision process because it describes how preferences develop over time and eventually produce choice. by contrast the original mgpm treats the decision process as static. dft assumes that people make choice between two or more actions. actions can have any number of possible consequences and each consequence may be considered in relation to one or morals. in our ongoing example the assistant professor faces choice between two actions for the summer focusing on research or focusing on teaching. there are at least four potential consequences of each action. for example if she focuses on her research she might succeed in getting paper published but receive poor teaching rating in the following semester succeed in getting paper published without receiving poor teaching rating fail to get the paper published and receive poor teaching rating or fail to get the paper published without receiving poor teaching rating. some of these consequences may not be fully considered by the decision maker particularly if the decision is being made rapidly or the preference for one option dominates the others. dft uses the term motivational value to describe the attractiveness of consequence. motivational value is function of two factors the need to act on each goal and the quality of the consequence in relation to each goal. the need to act is function of the discrepancy between the current state and thal. quality refers to the degree of satisfaction that consequence provides with respect to particular goal. in thal pursuit context quality is proportional to the change in discrepancy that would occur if that particular consequence arose. to make the example more concrete table displays the qualities associated with the assistant professor research and teaching goals. as can be seen having the paper accepted would have quality of one with respect to the research goal because it brings our assistant professor one paper closer to achieving her goal of publishing papers. having the paper rejected would have quality of zero with respect to the research goal because it brings her no closer to that goal. receiving good teaching rating would have quality of zero with respect to the teaching goal because it brings her no closer to the undesired state that she is table qualities associated with teaching and research goals quality research goal teaching goal paper published paper not published poor teaching rating received poor teaching rating not received hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he rs. hi ar tic le is in te nd ed so le ly fo th pe rs on al us of th in di vi du al us er an is no to be di ss em in at ed br oa dl.  ballard yeo loft vancouver and neal striving to avoid. receiving poor teaching rating would have quality of with respect to the teaching goal because it brings her one course closer to the avoidancal. thus the motivational value of having the paper accepted will be larger when she is long way from her research goal. the motivational value of receiving poor teaching rating will be larger when she is close to the undesired teaching goal. dft assumes that when comparing actions individuals cannot simultaneously attend to all of the possible consequences of each action because they have limited information processing capacity. therefore individuals shift their attention between possible consequences as they deliberate over the decision. according to dft at each point in time the person considers one potential consequence of each action. the probability of person paying attention to consequence at given point in time is referred to as the attention wt. the attention wt reflects the perceived likelihood of consequence occurring if particular action is selected. for example table displays four possible consequences associated with prioritizing teaching or research as well as possible attention wts associated with each consequence. in this example when considering the consequences of prioritizing research the assistant professor is most likely to pay attention to the possibility of publishing paper but receiving poor teaching rating. when considering the consequences of prioritizing teaching she is most likely to pay attention to the possibility of receiving good teaching rating but not publishing paper. at each point in time the person compares the consequences being attended to for each action. this comparison results in momentary perception of the relative attractiveness of each action which is referred to as the momentary attractiveness. unlike expected utility in the mgpm which only varies in response to changes in the environment momentary attractiveness also varies as the person considers different consequences of an action consequences that are considered sequentially as the person makes the decision. for example our assistant professor might consider that if she prioritizes research she may get publication without receiving poor teaching rating whereas if she prioritizes her teaching she may avoid obtaining poor teaching rating but will not get publication either. at that point in time prioritizing research work would be more attractive to the assistant professor than prioritizing teaching. thus the momentary attractiveness of focusing on research would be positive whereas the momentary attractiveness of focusing on teaching would be negative. when the assistant professor shifts her attention to alternative conse quences the momentary attractiveness of each action changes. for example the assistant professor may then consider the possibility that if she prioritizes research she may get publication but at the cost of receiving poor teaching rating. at this point in time focusing on research would become less attractive. within dft the transitory momentary attractiveness of each action cumulates during the sampling process to determine preference. for example if the assistant professor continues to focus on consequences that make focusing on research appear more attractive than focusing on teaching her preference for prioritizing research will increase over time. if she then focuses on consequences that make prioritizing teaching appear more attractive her preference for prioritizing teaching will start to increase. she will continue to shift attention between different consequences while comparing the actions until the preference for one of the actions exceeds threshold. at this point the action for which preference breached the threshold is selected. the threshold represents the strh of preference required before one is willing to select course of action. lower thresholds generally lead to faster but less accurate decisions. higher thresholds generally lead to slower but more accurate decisions. use of the threshold parameter therefore enables dft to naturally accommodate both rapid and slow decision making. thresholds have been shown to relate to stable factors that influence how cautious or urgent individuals are when making decisions. however this parameter can also be influenced by environmental factors such as perceived time pressure. figure shows an example of the sequential sampling process as the assistant professor considers the potential consequences of the different courses of action. when making choice between two actions preference is expressed on bipolar continuum with positive values indicating preference for one action and negative values indicating preference for the other action. as can be seen her preference for focusing on research versus teaching was initially equal. as deliberation proceeded preference first accumulated in the negative direction. however as deliberation continued preference started to accumulate in the positive direction. eventually preference breached the threshold in the positive direction and the assistant professor decided to prioritize research. development of the mgpm in this section we introduce the mgpm. like the mgpm the mgpm assumes that individuals monitor the discrepancy between their current state and their goal. the discrepancy and the importance of thal together determine the valence of acting on thal. the person also monitors resources available and the expected resources required to reach the goal and the difference between these influences the expectancy of reaching thal. valence and expectancy combine to determine the expected utility of thal which represents one motivation to act on thal at given point in time. as summarized in table the mgpm introduces several modifications to the mgpm to enable the model to explain more complex choice problems and to account for the effects of avoidancals. table example of possible attention wts for the consequences of prioritizing teaching versus research priority paper published paper not published prioritize research poor teaching rating received.. poor teaching rating not received.. prioritize teaching poor teaching rating received.. poor teaching rating not received.. hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he

sufficient capacity to systematically assess the expected utility of each action when those actions have multiple possible consequences. instead people deliberate over the decision considering the various consequences sequentially. the attractiveness of consequence referred to as motivational value is determined by the potential change in discrepancy for each goal and the expected utilities of thosals. at given point in time the person considers one potential consequence for each action. the relative attractiveness of each consequence being considered determines the momentary attractiveness of the actions. as the person considers different consequences over time they develop preferences for the different actions. the person continues to consider different consequences until preference for one action reaches threshold at which point that action is selected. figure provides graphical summary of the mgpm. the figure summarizes dynamic process involving goals and where actionsand are being considered and where each action has consequence and. the figure is divided into three layers. the first layer expected utility of goals illustrates the mechanisms that determine the expected utility of acting on each goal. in this layer ua and ub denote the expected utility of goals and respectively. the second layer motivational value of consequences illustrates how the expected utility of acting on each goal combines with the quality of each consequence to determine the motivational value of the possible consequences for each action. in this layer mx and mx denote the possible consequences of actionwhereas my and my denote the possible consequences of action. the third layer choice of action illustrates how the motivational values and the attention wts combine to influence the choice process. in the subsections that follow we provide the mathematical specification for the model. discrepancy like the original mgpm the mgpm assumes that goals are reference values or standards and that the person compares the current state of the variable to thal to determine discrepancy. the sign of the discrepancy is determined by whether or not the reference value has been surpassed. we define the discrepancy as positive when the reference value has not been surpassed so that it decreases as the current state moves closer to the reference value. this definition enables the mgpm to be applicable across range of goal pursuit scenarios. we have used the example of the academic trying to publish at least papers while ensuring that she does not receive more than poor teaching ratings. this example is scenario in which the person is trying to ensure that variable is greater than or equal to its reference value and trying to prevent variable from reaching or exceeding its reference value. in these situations the discrepancy is calculated by subtracting the current state of the variable from thal. positive discrepancy occurs when the variable value is less than thal which in this scenario means that thal has not yet been surpassed. of course other scenarios are possible. in some situations goal is surpassed when the variable value drops below the reference value. an example is manager trying to bring the number of safety incidents down to an acceptable level. this is an approach goal because it is desired state that the person is striving to achieve. however in this case the discrepancy is calculated by subtracting thal from the current state. the same is true if the person is trying to prevent the variable from reaching or falling below the reference value such as manager trying to prevent the firm capital reserves from falling below particular level. this represents an avoidancal because the person is trying to prevent the system reaching an undesired state. in this case the discrepancy is positive when the starting capital reserve level is above thal and it decreases as the capital reserves are drained away. valence the mgpm assumes that the valence of an approach goal decreases as the person moves closer to thal. consider the example of the assistant professor aiming for papers before her tenure deadline. when she only has one paper the valence of acting on that goal will be high but as shts more papers and thus closer to achieving her goal the valence of acting on thal will reduce. in contrast the valence of an avoidancal should increase as one moves closer to thal. when the assistant professor has not yet received any poor teaching ratings the valence of acting on the teaching goal will be low because she is long way from the undesired state. however if she starts getting poor teaching ratings the valence of acting on that goal should increase. to account for this relationship we introduce an intercept parameter which represents the valence of acting on thal when the current state is equal to thal. for approach goals we assume that the intercept is zero such that the valence decreases as the person gets closer to thal. thus for approach goals like those considered by the mgpm the intercept need not be included in the valence formula. however to handle positive threshold person chooses to

thal. in the mgpm thin parameter was positive. in the mgpm thin parameter is negative for avoidancals. because of this valence associated with an avoidance goal increases as the person gets closer to thal. finally we assume that valence cannot fall below. the mgpm defines valence as follows vk max.  the subscript denotes thal and denotes the time. thus vk represents the valence of goal at time. expectancy expectancy has traditionally been conceptualized as the subjective likelihood of an event occurring. when represented mathematically expectancy is tradition ally bounded between zero and one with zero indicating that the occurrence of the event is impossible and one indicating that the event is certain. value of. indicates that there is chance that the event will occur which is the point of maximum uncertainty. the original mgpm did not represent expectancy as subjective probability. in particular it had no upper limit. this representation creates difficulties when dealing with avoidance goals. specifically to deal with avoidancals we bound expectancy by zero and one. bounding expectancy in this way allows us to treat it like subjective probability in which the likelihood of an event not occurring is equal to one minus the likelihood of the event occurring. to accomplish this bounding we use logistic function. logistic functions are commonly used in neural network models to constrain function outputs to particular range and are used in psychophysical models to describe how people respond to changes in stimulus intensity. figure. graphical summary of the mgpm. the figure assumes that one is pursuing goals and where actionsand are being considered and where each action has consequence and. the symbols are defined as follows discrepancy valence gain valence

resource. hence the time required is subtracted from the time available. the difference is wted by time sensitivity parameter that represents the individual sensitivity to the difference between ta and tr. these elements are placed in logistic function to obtain the bounded expectancy values needed to represent both approach and avoidancals. the full equation is as follows ek exp trk.  equation provides convenient way to capture the effects of uncertainty associated with goal pursuit and time. according to this function expectancy should approach one as the difference between ta and tr becomes larger because the person should become more certain of reaching thal in the time available. expectancy should approach zero as the difference between ta and tr becomes smaller because the person should become more certain of not reaching thal in the time available. expectancy should equal. when tr equals ta because this is the point of maximum uncertainty when the chances of reaching thal before the deadline are equal to the chances not reaching it by the deadline. thus this equation also provides an improvement on the original mgpm because it assumes that when the time required to reach thal is equal to the time available person should expect chance of reaching goal. by contrast the original mgpm assumed that the expectancy of reaching thal should be in this situation. we assume that time sensitivity may be influenced by both individual differences and environmental factors. for example differences in impulsiveness may produce differences in time sensitivity. differences in the flexibility of deadline might also influence the sensitivity to time. higher values of mean that expectancy and therefore an individual decision is more sensitive to the difference between the time available and expected time required. likewise lower values of indicate lower level of sensitivity. in the simulation of the mgpm section we demonstrate that variability in time sensitivity can account for individual differences in whether people display the concurrent or sequential strategies. we should note that the mgpm time sensitivity parameter is conceptually similar to the timin parameter in the mgpm. both parameters influence the relationship between time and expectancy. the difference between the two parameters is that time sensitivity reflects sensitivity to the difference between ta and tr whereas timin reflects sensitivity only to ta. we made this change so that the parameter would still have meaningful effect figure. valence as function of discrepancy for

parameter with the difference between ta and tr produces clear effects on expectancy whereas multiplying the parameter only with ta has effects that are much more difficult to interpret. following the mgpm we define tr as the product of discrepancy and expected lag. tr is dynamic because discrepancies can change. expected lag is belief regarding the time needed to move one unit of discrepancy closer to thal. expected lag can change based on experience with the task or environmental cues. the expected time required is defined as follows trk dk.  expected utility according to the mgpm goal expected utility is the product of valence and expectancy. however this equation needs modification to account for the fact that high expectancies likely adversely affect the expected utility of avoidancals. expectancy is positively related to the expected utility of an approach goal because high expectancy indicates high likelihood of reaching the desired goal. expectancy should be negatively related to expected utility of an avoidancal because the person is trying not to reach thal. there are number of ways that this idea could be implemented within model. simple way is to define expected utility using separate equations for approach and avoidance goals. for approach goals expected utility is defined as follows uk vk ek.  for avoidancals expected utility is positively related to the expectancy of not reaching thal in the time available. because we have modified the specification of expectancy to include an upper bound of one expectancy can be treated like probability. the expectancy of not reaching thal is therefore equal to one minus the expectancy of reaching thal. the expected utility of acting on an avoidancal is therefore defined as follows uk vk.  motivational value dft assumes that motivational value is function of quality and discrepancy. the expectancy of achieving goal is not represented in dft because the problems dft has addressed are not the type where expectancy is likely to have strong influence such as the satisfaction of hunger or safety. however people need to consider the likelihood of goal attainment when dealing with achievement goals because there is no point spending time pursuing goal that is unachievable. the mgpm therefore assumes that the motivational value of consequence is function of quality and the expected utility of acting on thal. thus the motivational value of having the paper accepted will be higher to the extent that it is possible to achieve thal of papers in the time remaining before the tenure deadline. the mgpm defines the motivational value of consequence of an action as follows mij uk qijk.  the subscripts and denote the action and consequence re spectively. thus mij represents the motivational value of consequence of action at time. attention according to dft the focus of attention at given point in time is determined stochastically. for each action each consequence has probability that the person will attend to it which is referred to as the attention wt. dft assumes that the attention wt is related to the probability of the consequence occurring people are more likely to pay attention to the most likely consequences. for example our assistant professor may believe that if she focuses on her teaching she will avoid receiving poor teaching rating. she is therefore more likely to pay attention to this possibility when considering the consequences of focusing on teaching. this assumption is supported by eye tracking studies demonstrating that when making decisions with consequences that vary in their probability of occurring people fixate more on outcomes that are more probable. the attention allocated to particular consequence of an action at given moment is referred to as the momentary attention and is denoted wij. momentary attention can only be allocated to one consequence at time for each action. thus wij is equal to either or and the total attention allocated across all consequences for particular action at any given moment equals for consequence of action w for all other consequences of action must be. momentary attractiveness the momentary attractiveness for each action is determined by the motivational value of the consequence that is being attended to at that moment. for example the momentary attractiveness of focusing on research would be higher when the assistant professor considers the possibility that she might get publication than when she considers the possibility that she might not get publication. the momentary attractiveness of focusing on teaching would be higher when the assistant professor considers the possibility of receiving good teaching rating than when she considers the possibility of receiving poor teaching evaluation. following dft the mgpm defines momentary attractiveness as follows ai j wij mij.  according to the above equation the momentary attractiveness of action at time is equal to the motivational value of the consequence that is being attended to at that time because the the construct we refer to as momentary attractiveness is referred to as valence by decision field theory. we relabeled this construct because the mgpm also includes valence construct that is formally distinct from the valence construct in decision field theory. hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th

the mgpm assumes that preference changes over time according to the following equation p.  in our example represents the momentary attractiveness of prioritizing research and represents the momentary attractiveness of prioritizing teaching. positive values of preference therefore indicate that prioritizing research is preferred whereas negative values indicate that prioritizing teaching is preferred. the term in the equation means that preference is variable with memory. it moves from its last value based on the differences in the actions momentary attractiveness at given point in time. simulation of the mgpm in this section wnerate predictions for the mgpm by conducting simulation study. in this study we simulate the model under different conditions and examine the emnt behavior of the model in each one. the results of the simulation represent the model predictions. we test those predictions in an empirical study described in the next section. we constructed the simulation study to address three specific research questions. each research question corresponds to an aim of the paper. the first research question relates to how prioritization is influenced by avoidancals rq how does prioritization differ when pursuing two approach goals two avoidancals or one approach and one avoidancal. the second research question relates to the complexity of prioritization decisions. the decision we examine in this paper is one where actions can involve risk. we examine prioritization as function of whether the outcomes of actions are risky or certain. by risky we mean that actions have more than one possible consequence but that the person knows the probability that each consequence will occur. by certain we mean that each action has one consequence that is guaranteed to occur. the second research question is as follows rq how does prioritization differ when actions are risky compared with when actions are certain. the third research question relates to the model ability to account for prioritization strategies. we argue that differences in strategy can be accounted for by the time sensitivity parameter in the model. high level of time sensitivity makes people more attuned to the likelihood that each goal can be achieved. as result of this increased sensitivity people should be more likely to make prioritization decisions based on expectancy. thus high levels of time sensitivity should make people more likely to work on the goal that has theatest likelihood of attainment at any point in time and therefore more likely to display the sequential strategy. this means that when pursuing approach goals people should be more likely to prioritize thal with the smallest discrepancy and when pursuing avoidancals people should be more likely to prioritize thal with the largest discrepancy. low level of time sensitivity makes people less attuned to the likelihood that each goal can be achieved. as result people should be less likely to make prioritization decisions based on expectancy. thus low levels of time sensitivity should make people more likely to work on thal that has the highest valence at any point in time and to display the concurrent strategy. therefore the third research question is rq how does the time sensitivity parameter influence prioritization strategy. simulation method description we created simulation study that mirrored the task that we used in the experiment described subsequently to validate the model predictions. this experimental task required the participant to make series of prioritization decisions while pursuing two goals. participants were assigned one approach and one avoidancal two approach goals or two avoidancals. the task required participants to make series of choices between two actions. each action prioritized onal at the expense of the other for example by providing the opportunity to make progress toward onal while missing out on the opportunity to make progress toward the other. we varied the level of risk associated with the actions. in the risky condition the action had two possible consequences with an equal probability of occurring if the action was selected. in the certain condition the action had one certain consequence if the action was selected. simulating computational model typically involves fixing the parameters to specific values. the choice of these values can be important because the parameters influence the behavior of the simulation. if parameters are fixed to values that are not observed in the population of interest the behavior of the simulation may not reflect the process under investigation. fortunately some parameter values can be selected based on the fact that they are reasonablven the task environment. this was the table parameter values specified for the model simulation parameter description specified values intercept of valence function bapproach bavoidance goal importance approach avoidance time sensitivity expected lag attention wts equal to objective probability of outcomes threshold note. the notation indicates that the value is sampled from normal distribution withand. hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc

case for the valence intercept gain expected lag and attention wt parameters. we fixed the valence intercept to for approach and for avoidance and thin parameter to for approach goals and for avoidancals. these values were reasonable because they ensured that the overall level of valence would be approximately equal for approach and avoidancals. we fixed the expected lag to. this value was reasonable because on average it would take two units of time to reduce each discrepancy by one unit in this task. we fixed the attention wts to equal the objective probabilities of the consequences which was reasonable because dft predicts that the probability of attending to consequence relates to the probability of that consequence occurring. in contrast to the above parameters we did not have priori estimates of time sensitivity and threshold because these values vary across individuals. we therefore simulated range of values for these parameters to ensure the simulation results were robust. common method for ensuring robust results is to run multiple simulations where parameter values are sampled randomly from distribution that reflects the variability of that parameter in the population of interest. the results can be collapsed across simulations to illustrate the behavior that is most likely to occur in that population. we used this method to generate time sensitivity and threshold parameters. we identified the distribution of these parameters by fitting the mgpm to data from previous study of multiplal pursuit where the parameters for each participant were estimated. in the previous study the time sensitivity parameter had mean of. and standard deviation of. the threshold parameter had mean of. and standard deviation of. we used these values to generate the sampling distributions for each parameter in the simulation study. we ran one million simulations in matlab for each goal type crossed with risk combination. each simulation included decisions. the model predicted the probability of selecting the action that prioritized goal. we simulated the actual decision by randomly sampling from uniform distribution with minimum of and maximum of. if the sampled value was less than the predicted probability of prioritizing goal the model prioritized goal if not the model prioritized goal. the dependent variable of interest was the action selected because this indicated which goal was being prioritized. this method ensured that over large number of observations the proportion of times the model selected the action that prioritized goal would match the predicted probability of prioritizing goal. we examined research questions and by examining how the likelihood of an action being selected varied according to thal type and risk manipulations. we examined research question by examining how the likelihood of selecting an action differed depending on the value of the time sensitivity parameter. to do this wouped the simulations according to the time sensitivity parameter value. simulations were classified as very low time sensitivity if the value of the time sensitivity parameter was below the th percentile low time sensitivity if the value was between the th and th percentiles high time sensitivity if the value was between the th and th percentiles and very high time sensitivity if the value was above the th percentile. we examined the simulation results for these four groups separately. simulation results and discussion previous research on multiple-approach goal pursuit has plotted prioritization effects as function of relative discrepancy. for example schmidt and deshon plotted prioritization as function of whether goal discrepancy was larger than equal to or smaller than the discrepancy for the other goal. we do the same for the approach approach and avoidance avoidance conditions. for the approach avoidance condition we plot the predictions as function of the time. discrepancy has opposing effects for approach and avoidancals and as result these effects cannot be interpreted if the data are plotted as function of relative discrepancy. the simulation results revealed that goal type risk and time sensitivity had an interactive influence on prioritization. to simplify the presentation of this interaction we present the results in two stages. we first present the results for the approach avoidance condition. we then present the results for the approach approach and avoidance avoidance conditions. approach avoidance figure shows the proportion of times the model selected the action that prioritized the approach goal as function of the time risk and individual differences in time sensitivity. in general the model initially prioritized the approach goal. over time however priority shifted from the approach goal to the avoidancal. this pattern emd because at the start of goal pursuit there was relatively large distance to cover before either the desired or the undesired state would be reached. in this situation the valence of acting on the approach goal is relatively high whereas the valence of acting on the avoidancal is relatively low. over time as the model got closer to the approach goal the valence of acting on the approach goal decreased. at the same time the model also got closer to the avoidancal because the avoidancal had not been initially prioritized. the valence of acting on the avoidance goal therefore increased. this change in valence eventually caused the expected utility of acting on the avoidancal to exceed the expected utility of acting on the approach goal prompting shift in priority. the shift in priority from approach to avoidance also depended on risk. the effects of time were stronger when the consequences of actions were certain than risky. when the consequences of actions were certain initial preference for the approach goal was stronger and the shift from approach to avoidance more pronounced than when the consequences were risky. this result emd because attention is variable when actions are risky because of the multiple possible consequences. however attention is less variable when actions are certain because there is only one consequence. the htened variability in attention when deciding between risky actions made the choices at given point in time less predictable. finally time sensitivity had only weak influence on prioritization. when actions were risky there was virtually no difference in prioritization as function of time sensitivity. when actions hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he rs. hi ar tic le is in te nd ed so le ly fo th pe rs on al us of th in di vi du al us er an is no to be di ss em in at ed br oa dl.  ballard yeo loft vancouver and neal were certain time sensitivity appeared to influence the timing of the shift in priority from approach to avoidance. when time sensitivity was lower the switch in priority from approach to avoidance occurred earlier when time sensitivity was higher the switch in priority occurred later. this result emd because lower levels of time sensitivity represent less sensitivity to the deadline which increases the likelihood of switching priority before the approach goal is achieved. approach approach and avoidance avoidance for the conditions in which both goals are of the same type we refer to each goal as simply goal or goal. figures and show the proportion of times the model selected the action that prioritized goal as function of risk relative discrepancy and time sensitivity when pursuing two approach goals or when pursuing two avoidancals. goal type and time sensitivity both influenced the direction of the relationship between relative discrepancy and prioritization whereas risk influenced the strh of these relationships. in the approach approach condition the model most often prioritized thal with the larger discrepancy when time sensitivity was lower but prioritized thal with the smaller discrepancy when time sensitivity was higher. thus the model produces behavior that is consistent with the concurrent strategy

br oa dl. the mgpm between goals as relative discrepancy changes. however the model produces behavior consistent with the sequential strategy when time sensitivity is high because it prioritizes thal with theatest likelihood of attainment and it tends to prioritize that goal until it is achieved. in the avoidance avoidance condition different pattern emd. the model most often prioritized thal with the smaller discrepancy at almost all levels of time sensitivity. this pattern is consistent with the concurrent strategy because it prioritizes thal with the lowest likelihood of achievement. the pattern held unless time sensitivity was very high and actions were certain. in this case the model exhibited weak tendency to prioritize thal with the larger discrepancy. this difference in the predominance of each strategy between the approach approach and avoidance avoidance conditions emd because expected utility is more sensitive to differences in valence when valences are lower. valence had stronger effect in the avoidance avoidance condition than in the approach approach condition because valence is initially relatively low when pursuing avoidancals but relatively high when pursuing approach goals. as result the model was more likely to prioritize thal that was worse off in the avoidance avoidance condition than in the approach approach condition. finally risk influenced the strh of these relationships. the interaction between goal type relative discrepancy and time sensitivity was stronger when actions were certain compared with when they were risky. once again this effect was attributable to the htened variability in attention when actions were risky compared with when actions were certain. because of this htened variability in attention choices were less predictable when actions were risky. empirical test of the mgpm having generated predictions for the mgpm regarding the effects of goal type risk and time sensitivity on prioritization we now test those predictions empirically. we made several hypotheses based on the simulation results. we begin with hypotheses for the approach avoidance condition. in this condition we focus on the effects of time and risk because the simulation study revealed that these are the strongest predictors of prioritization. we made the following hypotheses when pursuing one approach and one avoidancal people will shift priority over time from the approach to the avoidancal. the shift in priority over time from the approach to the avoidancal will be more pronounced when actions are certain than when they are risky. we also made hypotheses for the approach approach condition. in this condition we focus on the effects of relative discrepancy risk and time sensitivity because the simulation study revealed that all three are strong predictors of prioritization. we made the following hypotheses when pursuing two approach goals people with lower time sensitivity will be more likely to prioritize thal with the larger discrepancy whereas people with higher time sensitivity will be more likely to prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy. the two-way interaction between relative discrepancy and time sensitivity described in will be stronger when actions are certain than when they are risky. finally we made hypotheses for the avoidance avoidance condition. in this condition time sensitivity influenced the magnitude of the effect of relative discrepancy but not the direction of that effect. our hypotheses are as follows when pursuing two avoidancals people with higher time sensitivity will show stronger tendency to prioritize the risky certain..... smaller than equal larger than a smaller than equal larger than relative discrepancy pr op or tio pr io ri tiz in g oa a time

smaller discrepancy than people with lower time sensitivity. the two-way interaction between relative discrepancy and time sensitivity described in will be stronger when actions are certain than when they are risky. in addition to examining whether the predictions of the mgpm are supported we also examine whether the empirical results can be accounted for by the original mgpm. demonstrating that the mgpm provides better account of the data than the previous model is important because the increased complexity of the mgpm can only be justified if the model has superior explanatory power. thus if the mgpm does not provide better account of the data the original mgpm should be preferred on thounds of parsimony. we therefore systematically compare the mgpm ability to explain the empirical results to the mgpm. we also compare the mgpm to two other alternatives to justify the integration of dft and the introduction of the valence intercept. our aim was to extend the mgpm to provide more sophisticated explanation that accounts for the complex choice problems encountered during multiplal pursuit enable the model to account for avoidancals and demonstrate that the model can account for individual differences in prioritization strategy. the extended model the mgpm is an integration of the original mgpm and dft that explains how people prioritize when pursuing different combinations of approach or avoidancals where actions involve risk or uncertainty and when actions can impact progress for more than onal. in simulation study we demonstrated that the mgpm predicts differences in prioritization as function of goal type risk and time sensitivity. the predictions of the mgpm corresponded with the behavior observed. as predicted individuals who pursued one approach and one avoidancal tended to switch priority from the approach goal to the avoidancal over time. among those pursuing two approach goals time sensitivity interacted with relative discrepancy in the manner that was predicted. participants with low value for the time sensitivity parameter tended to prioritize the goal with the larger discrepancy which is consistent with the concurrent strategy. participants with high value for the time sensitivity parameter tended to prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy which is consistent with the sequential strategy but only tended to do so when both actions were certain. everyone who pursued two avoidancals tended to display the concurrent strategy by prioritizing thal with the smaller discrepancy. as predicted these effects were stronger when the consequences of both actions were certain compared to when one or more of the actions were risky except in the case of those pursuing two avoidancals. we also showed that the mgpm provided better account of participants prioritization decisions than the original mgpm and that the major extensions to the model could be justified. in the following sections we discuss the theoretical empirical and practical contributions of this paper highlight potential limitations and suggest avenues for further research. contributions to the multiplal pursuit literature the mgpm generalized the original mgpm to include avoidancals. moreover it generated novel predictions that in gen hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is

data. the predictions regarding goal type conv on the notion that if expectancy is held constant people are more likely to prioritize thal with the higher valence. the model assumes that valence decreases as you get closer to desired state but increases as you get closer to an undesired state. as result people simultaneously pursuing one approach and one avoidancal tended to prioritize the approach goal earlier and the avoidancal later. the prediction emd because the valence and therefore the expected utility of acting on the avoidancal is lower when thal is further away and is therefore outwed by the expected utility of acting on the approach goal. it is important to note that the nature of the approach-to-avoidance priority shift may differ when the initial states for thals differ. for example if the initial state for the avoidancal was closer to the undesired state the priority shift may occur earlier because the expected utility of acting on the avoidancal would be higher. the mgpm prediction regarding risk is that the tendency to prioritize particular goal should be stronger when actions have more certain consequences. this prediction is direct consequence of incorporating dft into the mgpm. according to dft people pay attention to the most likely consequences of their actions. as risk levels increase people pay more attention to range of different consequences. this creates more variability in preferences over time which weakens the effect of goal expected utility. as result people make noisier decisions. seu theory cannot account for this tendency for decisions to become noisier as variability in possible consequences increases. we observed this effect of risk in the approach avoidance and approach approach conditions. indeed for participants in the approach approach condition with higher time sensitivity parameter values the effect of relative discrepancy disappeared when one or more action did not have certain consequences. these findings provide strong support for replacing the choice function in the original mgpm with the sequential sampling process described by dft when predicting complex choices. although the predictions of the mgpm were largely supported we did not find the expected effect of risk in the avoidance avoidance condition. in this condition people demonstrated consistent tendency to prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy regardless of risk. as result the model did not provide as close fit to the data when participants were pursuing two avoidancals and actions were risky as it did in other conditions. furthermore although the model correctly predicted the direction of the effect of risk in the approach avoidance condition it overestimated the strh of the effect. the shift in priority from approach to avoidance over time was stronger than predicted by the model when both actions were risky. these findings illustrate the value of using formal models because it is clear when model cannot account for the direction or strh of effects observed in the data. one explanation for the lack of an effect of risk in the avoidance avoidance condition is that people focus their attention more narrowly in the presence of avoidancals. allocating attention in this way would mean that attention fluctuates less when actions have multiple possible consequences and would therefore weaken the effect of risk. the mgpm might account for this by assuming that when avoidancals are present attention is not necessarily allocated in line with the objective probability of the possible consequences. finally the mgpm provides formal explanation for individual differences in prioritization strategy. we observed mix of behavioral patterns among participants pursuing two approach goals with some participants displaying the concurrent strategy and others displaying the sequential strategy. individual differences in strategy were reflected in the time sensitivity parameter. according to the mgpm when time sensitivity is higher people are more likely to make prioritization decisions based on expectancy. as result people will tend to display sequential strategy they will generally work on thal with theatest likelihood of attainment and continue to do so until that goal is sufficiently close to achievement. when time sensitivity is lower people are less likely to make prioritization decisions based on expectancy. as result people will tend to display concurrent strategy by working on thal with the highest valence and switch priority between goals as relative position changes. goal framing versus incentive framing in the experiment presented here we used incentives to reinforce the desirability of the approach goals and the undesirability of the avoidancals. it is therefore reasonable to ask whether the effect of the manipulation of goal type was due to the framing of thals or the framing of the incentives. however if our results were attributable to incentive framing then the original mgpm should be able to account for the effect of the experimental manipulation. this is because the original mgpm assumes that incentives influencal importance via thin parameter. our model comparisons revealed that the original mgpm did not explain participants decisions as well as the mgpm. we also examined an alternative model which was identical to the mgpm except that it did not contain the valence intercept the extension to the valence function that we argued was required to account for the effect of goal type. this alternative model could not account for the effect of the experimental manipulation either. furthermore the results of the current study are consistent with an unpublished study that manipulated only goal framing. this study replicated the finding that people pursuing two avoidancals tend to prioritize thal with the smaller discrepancy and people pursuing an approach and avoidancal tend to shift priority over time from the approach to the avoidancal. collectively these findings suggest that the effect of thal type manipulation observed in the current study was not simply due to incentive framing. nevertheless we still view incentive framing as an important avenue for future research. it would be useful to manipulatal framing and incentive framing independently to examine their interaction. such manipulation was not feasible in our study because of the complex design. however it would be possible to examine thal frame incentive frame interaction without manipulating risk. we predict that incentive frame should influence the strh of the effect of relative discrepancy and that the mgpm will account for the effect using thin parameter.  details available from the authors. hi

is no to be di ss em in at ed br oa dl. the mgpm schmidt and deshon showed that people pursuing two approach goals showed stronger tendency to prioritize thal in the worse position when incentives were framed as losses compared to gains. they argued that the effect of relative discrepancy was stronger in the former context because of loss aversion people are more sensitive to potential losses than gains of equivalent magnitude. if so then gain should be stronger when goals have incentives that are framed as losses regardless of whether thal is approach or avoidance. practical applications there are number of potential applications of the findings of this study in situations that require individuals to manage multiple goals. the finding that people shift priority from approach to avoidancals over time may be particularly important in safety critical industries such as mining aviation or medicine where people have to effectively manage safety and productivity goals. productivity is typically framed as an approach goal whereas safety is typically framed as an avoidancal. our results suggest that framing productivity and safety goals in this manner may lead people to prioritize productivity over safety. one way to encourage people to prioritize safety may be to frame safety as an approach goal. this is consistent with growing interest in the safety literature on promoting behaviors that make the work environment safe rather than preventing behaviors that make it unsafe. in aviation for example there has been shift away from conflict detection and avoidance which is an avoidancal toward separation assurance which is an approach goal. the current study provides insight into different ways to influence how individuals or teams allocate resources when managing multiple tasks. there are many situations in which people need to prioritize the allocation of resources. common examples include project management and task scheduling. under some circumstances the best strategy is to prioritize the task with theater amount of work required because it ensures that progress is made on both. under other circumstances the best strategy is to focus on the task with the least amount of work required to ensure that at least one task is completed by the deadline. our findings suggest that these choices are sensitive to the way that thals are framed and the level of uncertainty that employees have regarding the potential consequences of their actions. for example if manager wants employees to use the concurrent strategy it would make sense to frame thals in avoidance terms and to enhance the level of certainty regarding the consequences of actions. for example certainty may be enhanced by reducing the number of distractions in the work environment or allocating particular times to work exclusively on that task. however in many cases uncertainty will be unavoidable. our results imply that people will not show strong preferences for one strategy over the other when there is high level of uncertainty. this may well be adaptive because it means that people are more flexible in the way they prioritizals in an uncertain environment. the lack of variability in strategy in the avoidance avoidance context is interesting from practical perspective because it implies that conflict between avoidancals creates psychologically strong environment that limits the potential for individual differences to be expressed. this finding has implications for understanding how managers can use different types of goals to enhance team performance. strong situations can enhance cooperation because they provide clear behavioral norms. however too much homogeneity among team members can lead to poor group decision making. in the end goal framing may not provide one-size-fits-all solution for optimizing strategies among individuals and teams. however our results highlight the need for managers to be aware of the implications that goal frame has on strategy. additional considerations and avenues for future research one issue that should be considered is the assumption that the subjective immediate value of acting on goal is always linear function of the discrepancy. both the mgpm and dft share this assumption and are able to account for broad range of empirical phenomena. however this assumption may not always hold. for example if the assistant professor is told that she will lose her job if she does not publish papers before her tenure deadline the valence of publishing her tenth paper could be just as high as the valence of publishing her first. in this case valence may be more accurately described as step-function that drops only after the tenth paper is published. alternatively heath larrick and wu have made arguments that suggest the valence function may be nonlinear following the form described by prospect theory. it is worth noting that the mgpm cannot explain how well or how poorly people make decisions during multiplal pursuit. this type of examination requires evaluating people decisions against normative model. recent work has extended normative model of decision making to the multiplegoal pursuit context and found that people depart from optimal prioritization in systematic ways depending on whether they are pursuing approach or avoidancals. by comparing the mgpm predictions to this type of normative model it would be possible to assess the extent to which the mgpm predicts departures from optimality. in doing so future work may be able to use the mgpm to explain why people exhibit biases in decision making during multiplal pursuit. applicability of the mgpm the mgpm can be applied to different types of multiplal environments. in some cases goals are directly in conflict with each other such that progress toward onal precludes the possibility of progress toward another goal. in other cases it is possible to make progress toward both goals at the same time. in this experiment we assumed that person could make progress toward an approach goal if this goal was prioritized but could not make progress towards thal that was not prioritized. likewise the person could prevent themselves from moving toward an hi do cu en is co py ri gh te by th a er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca a ss oc ia tio or on of its al lie pu bl is he rs. hi ar tic le is

was guaranteed to move closer to it if thal was not prioritized. however the mgpm can also be applied to environments in which actions may simultaneously benefit multiplals or when the probabilities of making progress toward goals are different. research has shown that the effects that em in these types of environments are similar to the ones observed in the experiment presented above. ballard compared prioritization patterns in environments in which actions could simultaneously benefit both goals versus when they could only benefit onal at time and found few differences between the two environments. furthermore the qualitative pattern of prioritization when actions had an chance of benefitting goal was similar to the pattern when actions only had chance. although we only examined prioritization involving two goals the model can be applied to any number of goals. the mgpm can also bneralized to choices involving more than two actions in the same way as dft by assuming that the preference state for each action undes separate accumulation process and that preference for one action suppresses preference for the other actions. in this way the mgpm can account for the fact that people take longer to decide between three or more actions than they do to decide between two. the mgpm can also bneralized to decisions involving uncertainty rather than risk by assuming that attention wts change as people learn the likelihood of different consequences. moreover we only examined an environment in which disturbances affected the consequence of an action. however there are other types of disturbances. the mgpm can bneralized to situations in which disturbances may affect the time it takes for the consequence of an action to become apparent or alter the state of the variable being controlled in the absence of any action being carried out. it is important to recognize that some of the parameters included in the original mgpm and dft were not addressed in this paper. all of the parameters from each theory are relevant to the mgpm and are important for understanding decision making during multiplal pursuit mornerally. for parsimony however we focused this paper on parameters that we believed were most important to understanding the effects of approach avoidance framing and risk on prioritization. here we discuss additional parameters and provide suggestions for how they might be incorporated in future research. for example the original mgpm includes an expected lag bias parameter that represents individuals beliefs regarding the rate of progress that can be achieved when working toward goal. this parameter is potentially important for understanding source of optimism or pessimism in expectancy. the model presented in this paper assumed that when someone is completely ignorant of the difference between the time available and the expected time required to reach thal expectancy would always equal. however incorporation of the bias parameter would explain how person who is optimistic about the achievable rate of progress might have an expectancy of greater than.  or how pessimistic person might have an expectancy of less than. dft includes self-feedback parameters that produce return to baseline phenomenon in which memory for preferences decays over time. it also includes lateral inhibition parameters that produce suppression whereby preference for one action is inhibited by preference for another action. these parameters are particularly relevant for understanding choices involving more than two actions. busemeyer and townsend also introduce an approach avoidancadient parameter. this parameter enables the model to account for the fact that people take longer to decide between actions with undesirable consequences than they do to decide between actions with desirable consequences. we did not address this parameter because it has little effect on choice probabilities. however this parameter will be important for future research seeking to model the relationship between goal framing and the time it takes to make prioritization decision. conclusion the mgpm represents step forward in the development of formal unified theory of multiplal pursuit. we demonstrated that the mgpm can explain how people make prioritization decisions when pursuing different combinations of approach and avoidancals and when the consequences of actions vary in their level of risk. we hope that the mgpm will be used as foundation for continued development of general theory of motivation and decision making that explains the importance of goals in navigating the complexity and uncertainty of one environment and in doing so helps to build stronger bridge between basic psychological science and organization studies. \n",
