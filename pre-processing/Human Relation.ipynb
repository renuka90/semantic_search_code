at work\\nkim elsesser and letitia anne peplau\\n\\na b s t r ac t this study explores cross-sex friendships within the professional\\n\\nworkplace and examined the impact of the workplace environment\\n\\nand htened awareness of sexual harassment on cross-sex friend-\\n\\nship formation. results from interviews with 41 professionals suggest\\n\\nthe existence of obstacles to developing cross-sex friendships at\\n\\nwork. specifically, these professionals worried that their cross-sex\\n\\nfriends would misinterpret their friendliness as romantic or sexual\\n\\ninterest, that their co-workers would misinterpret their friendliness\\n\\nto a cross-sex friend, and that their humor and conversational topics\\n\\nmight be perceived by a cross-sex friend as sexual harassment.\\n\\nbarriers to cross-sex friendship at work were labeled the ‘glass\\n\\npartition,’ and the potential impact of this glass partition on women’s\\n\\nand men’s careers is discussed.\\n\\nk e y wo r d s cross-sex friendship � gender � organizational behavior � sexual\\nharassment � work environment\\n\\ncross-sex friendships can be difficult to develop and maintain under any\\ncircumstances (o’meara, 1989). issues stemming from male-female differ-\\nences in friendship norms and interests, sexual attraction, and concerns that\\na cross-sex friendship may be misperceived as sexual all pose potential chal-\\nls (martin, 1997; swain, 1992). within the workplace, where friend-\\nships are particularly important for career development (kram & isabella,\\n1985), physical proximity and job requirements may facilitate cross-sex\\n\\n1 0 7 7\\n\\nhuman relations\\n\\ndoi: 10.1177/0018726706068783\\n\\nvolume 59(8): 1077–1100\\n\\ncopyright © 2006\\n\\nthe tavistock institute ®\\n\\nsage publications\\n\\nlondon, thousand oaks ca,\\n\\nnew delhi \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfriendship formation. on the contrary, other organizational influences such\\nas fear that a cross-sex friendship may be misperceived as a romantic\\nrelationship or fear of sexual harassment charges may decrease interactions\\nbetween cross-sex co-workers, limiting the pool of potential friends. the\\npresent analysis of interviews with professionals investigates the impact of\\nthe workplace on the development and maintenance of these friendships.\\n\\nworkplace friendships are important because they can provide benefits\\nwhich promote career success. lincoln and miller (1979) defined friendship\\nnetworks in organizations as ‘systems for making decisions, mobilizing\\nresources, concealing or transmitting information, and performing other\\nfunctions closely allied with work behavior and interaction’ (p. 196). friends\\nin the workplace provide information, networking, and support that are\\ninvaluable for both job performance and satisfaction (kram & isabella,\\n1985; lincoln & miller, 1979).\\n\\nbridge and baxter (1992) found that work friends provided career\\nsupport in three forms. friends provided information access, serving ‘as a\\nsecond pair of eyes and ears for one another.’ friends also provided work-\\nrelated assistance, helping each other accomplish their job tasks. third,\\nfriends gave psychological support to one another, ‘providing understanding,\\nempathy and comfort’ (bridge & baxter, 1992: 216).\\n\\nwhile friendships with peers are important, relationships with those\\nmore senior in the organization can also be valuable to the careers of junior\\nemployees. sometimes these mentor relationships are formally initiated and\\nmanaged by the organization, but more often they are informal relationships\\nsimilar to friendships (ragins & cotton, 1999). mentors can provide advice\\nand information, offer protection, and promote the mentee’s career by\\nmaking his or her accomplishments more visible (burke, 1984; kram &\\nisabella, 1985; mobley , 1994).\\n\\ngiven the substantial advantages that friendships in the workplace\\noffer, those not able to form friendships are at a career disadvantage. a pref-\\nerence for same-sex friendships restricts an individual’s pool of potential\\nfriends. this may have the most impact for women in male-dominated work\\nenvironments who need to befriend men in order to develop both peer friend-\\nships and mentor-like relationships. extending the previous research on\\ncross-sex friendships to the workplace may therefore illuminate an import-\\nant barrier to women’s career advancement.\\n\\ncross-sex friendships\\n\\nto date, research on barriers to the development of cross-sex friendships has\\ntypically been conducted outside the context of work. nonetheless, this\\n\\nhuman relations 59(8)1 0 7 8\\n\\n\\n\\nresearch suggests several important factors that may be relevant to work-\\nplace friendships. first, gender differences in recreational interests and\\npreferred topics of conversation result in a preference for same-sex friends\\n(martin, 1997; swain, 1992). in addition, gender differences in norms and\\nexpectations of friendships could cause problems for cross-sex friends. for\\nexample, men often disapprove of their same and cross-sex friends crying\\nwhile women approve of this behavior (felmlee, 1999).\\n\\nsexual attraction toward a potential friend can spur the initiation of a\\ncross-sex friendship. however, in situations where a romantic or sexual\\nrelationship is inappropriate or where one partner prefers a non-romantic\\nfriendship, sexual undercurrents often jeopardize cross-sex relationships\\n(kaplan & keys, 1998; monsour, 1992; swain, 1992; werking, 1997).\\nfinally, friends are concerned that a platonic cross-sex friendship will be\\nmisconstrued by third parties as romantic (monsour , 1994; o’meara,\\n1989; swain, 1992).\\n\\nworkplace environment\\n\\nsince little research has examined cross-sex friendship in the workplace, the\\neffects of organizational influences on these friendships remains unknown.\\ncertain aspects of the work environment may facilitate cross-sex friendship\\ndevelopment while others may hinder the development of new friendships.\\n\\nmany workplaces encourage teamwork (beyerlein , 1995) which\\nleads to greater interaction between employees. therefore, the workplace\\npotentially provides an environment where men and women can work closely\\ntogether to achieve common goals. consequently, the workplace offers co-\\nworkers proximity, familiarity, and common interests, all of which have been\\nshown to promote liking and friendship (berscheid & reis, 1998). this\\nsuggests that cross-sex friendships may be easier to develop within the work-\\nplace than outside of work.\\n\\nother current workplace trends may inhibit cross-sex friendship. for\\nexample, since workplace romances are often discouraged, some may want\\nto avoid any possibility that their co-workers misperceive a friendship as a\\nromance. even co-workers who are participants in workplace romances typi-\\ncally attempt to keep their romance a secret (anderson & hunsaker, 1985).\\nunlike friendships and other work-sanctioned relationships, workplace\\nromances can be disruptive to the organization and typically lead to negative\\ngossip (bowes-sperry & tata, 1999; mainiero, 1986; powell & graves,\\n2003). the romantic label can be particularly damaging when the alleged\\ncouple are not peers in the organization. for example, powell (2001) found\\nthat when those perceived to be in a romantic relationship are not peers, and\\n\\nelsesser & peplau thass partition 1 0 7 9\\n\\n\\n\\nthe subordinate is female, other employees tend to believe that the relation-\\nship is utilitarian (where sex is traded for career advancement). once a\\nrelationship is deemed utilitarian, outsiders may question the basis for work-\\nrelated rewards from the higher-level participant. to date, there is no\\nresearch on how this fear of third-party misperception of cross-sex friend-\\nship impacts friendships at work.\\n\\nsimilarly, the increased awareness of sexual harassment within organiz-\\nations may impact cross-sex friendship development. a recent survey by the\\nsociety for human resources management (shrm) found that 97 percent\\nof organizations had sexual harassment policies, and 62 percent had formal\\ntraining in dealing with sexual harassment (shrm, 1999). however, little\\nresearch has addressed how increased awareness of sexual harassment has\\nimpacted interactions between cross-sex co-workers. one survey of university\\nprofessors found that 68 percent were concerned about being unjustly accused\\nof sexual harassment, and 45 percent had modified their behavior toward\\nstudents due to that concern (nicks, 1996). in addition, gutek (1997) suggests\\nthat ‘the adversarial nature of the formal complaint procedures has had the\\neffect of polarizing men and women in the workplace’ (p. 196).\\n\\nfinally, an examination of the literature on social networks and mentor\\nrelationships provides material relevant to cross-sex friendships at work. the\\npreference of men to associate with other men has been well-established in\\nthe literature on social networks (see mcpherson , 2001 for a review).\\namong managers, men tend to have mornder homophilous networks\\nthan do women (ibarra, 1992, 1995). the causes for samnder preference\\nin these work networks have included similarity (individuals choose to be\\nclose to those who are similar to themselves) and contact (people are most\\nlikely to come into contact with others like themselves).\\n\\nresearch on cross-sex mentor relationships (typically male mentor and\\nfemale protégé) indicates they can be more difficult to develop than same-\\nsex mentor relationships. cross-sex mentor pairs socialize less outside of\\nwork than same-sex mentor pairs, and report their relationships are harder\\nto initiate due to fear that the prospective mentor or other co-workers would\\nmisconstrue their friendliness as sexual interest (ragins & cotton, 1999).\\nthese same concerns may apply to cross-sex friendship development in the\\nworkplace.\\n\\nthe purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate friendships\\nwithin the professional workplace and to examine what impact, if any, the\\nworkplace environment has on cross-sex friendship formation. structured\\ninterviews were combined with a questionnaire in order to obtain a broad\\nrange of descriptions of friendship development within organizations. we\\nfocused exclusively on professionals in this study as one example of how the\\n\\nhuman relations 59(8)1 0 8 0\\n\\n\\n\\nwork environment impacts cross-sex friendships. it will be left to future\\nresearch to explore how other categories of workers’ cross-sex friendships\\nare affected by their organizations.\\n\\nthe professionals in this study reported receiving substantial benefits from\\ntheir friends at work. in addition to making the workday more enjoyable,\\nfriends provided valuable advice, information, and assistance. although it\\nwas easier for the professionals to meet people and make friends at work\\nthan outside work, the participants reported the majority of their closest\\nfriends at work were of the same sex. even women working in predomi-\\nnantly male organizations tended to form more friendships with women than\\nwith men.\\n\\nalthough many factors undoubtedly contribute to this pattern of same-\\nsex friendships at work, several were particularly noteworthy. similar inter-\\nests played a role in the friendship development of the professionals in this\\nstudy, and gender differences in interests may lead to a preference for same-\\nsex friends (martin, 1997; swain, 1992). however, within the workplace,\\nco-workers share a common interest in the work they perform, which facili-\\ntates friendship development. the majority of the participants’ closest friend-\\nships in the present study were launched as a result of cooperating on a work\\nproject. although gendered interests may still pose some obstacle to friend-\\nships within the workplace, they most likely create a more substantial barrier\\nto friendships outside of work.\\n\\ninstead, barriers to cross-sex friendship at work centered around\\naspects of the work environment that discourage romantic entanglements\\namong co-workers and seek to prevent sexual harassment. professionals were\\nconcerned that their co-workers might misperceive a platonic cross-sex\\nfriendship as an inappropriate sexual liaison. while misperception is also a\\nconcern of cross-sex friends outside of the workplace, it may present a\\ngreater barrier inside the organization, where co-workers speculate about the\\nmotives of the perceived romantic partners (bowes-sperry & tata, 1999;\\nmainiero, 1986; powell & graves, 2003). in addition, men reported concern\\nthat women at work might misinterpret a friendly overture as sexual harass-\\nment, or that women would take offense at their jokes or topics of conver-\\nsation. women were concerned that men felt uncomfortable in their presence\\nand therefore might avoid them. these concerns appeared to be more\\n\\nelsesser & peplau thass partition 1 0 9 3\\n\\n\\n\\ncommon in interactions with acquaintances and casual friends than among\\nclose friends and between senior and subordinate pairs than between peers.\\n\\non a positive note, the findings of this study suggest that sexual harass-\\nment policies are working. men reported they joke less in front of women\\nand are less likely to perform behaviors that may be interpreted as harass-\\nment. women concur that men joke less around them, and that men are less\\nlikely to be alone in an office with a woman. certainly these behaviors create\\na workplace with a less hostile environment for women. however, an\\nadditional, unintended consequence of increased sexual harassment aware-\\nness is that it may make cross-sex friendships harder to develop. consistent\\nwith research that indicates that women perceive more behaviors as harass-\\ning, the male participants restricted their behavior around women, but not\\naround men, increasing contact among men (berryman-fink & riley, 1997;\\nsolomon & williams, 1997). furthermore, the same interactions that were\\ndeemed inappropriate for cross-sex communication were utilized to develop\\nsame-sex friendships. for example, male employees described initiating\\nfriendships by joking with other men, but not women. a male participant\\nwho complimented a woman on her clothes is charged with harassment,\\nwhile a female participant reported offering clothing compliments to other\\nwomen to start friendships. if co-workers believe that same-sex friends will\\nnot label their behavior as harassing, they may have a larger range of\\nbehaviors to utilize in initiating same-sex friendships.\\n\\nthass partition\\n\\nalong with obstacles associated with cross-sex friendships outside of the\\norganization, organizational practices that hten workers’ fears about\\nsexual harassment and proper conduct on the job may create barriers that\\ninhibit male and female employees from crossing thnder line to form\\ncross-sex friendships. we label these barriers to cross-sex friendship in the\\nworkplace the ‘glass partition.’ much like thass ceiling which prevents\\nwomen from reaching the top levels of corporations, thass partition may\\ndifferentially disadvantage women who work in predominantly male\\norganizations. as participants in this study clearly indicated, friends can be\\ninvaluable to success on the job.\\n\\nfactors that limit a worker’s range of friends based on gender place\\ngreater restrictions on women than on men. for example, women in male-\\ndominated professions need to befriend men in order to obtain the infor-\\nmation and networking necessary for career success. men in these\\nprofessions, however, have sufficient numbers of same-sex co-workers and\\nsenior managers to befriend.\\n\\nhuman relations 59(8)1 0 9 4\\n\\n\\n\\nobstacles to cross-sex friendships may also limit women’s ability to\\nestablish friendships with senior employees which could evolve into mentor\\nrelationships. the present research suggests that the barriers to cross-sex\\nfriendship may beater for friendships between superiors and subordi-\\nnates. since men often hold the most powerful positions in corporations (\\nin 2002, 84 percent of the corporate officers in fortune 500 companies were\\nmen [catalyst, 2002]), women who are not able to forge friendships with\\nmen in their workplace may be left with less powerful mentors or no mentors\\nat all. this may be particularly true for women who are senior within their\\norganization and must seek out mentors at the top levels of the organization.\\n\\nalthough some have suggested same-sex mentor relationships may be\\nmore effective than cross-sex relationships, the research is inconclusive as to\\nwhether same-sex mentor relationships or cross-sex mentor relationships are\\nmore beneficial to the protégé (see powell, 1999, for review). however,\\nbecause of their power in the organizations, male mentors may have the\\nability to provide more valuable support to both their male and female\\nprotégés. for example, dreher and cox (1996) found that both male and\\nfemale mba graduates with male mentors were able to attain greater\\ncompensation than those with female mentors. once again, women who\\nhave more difficulty establishing friendships or mentor relationships with\\nmen in the organization have a career disadvantage.\\n\\nby contrast, thass partition may have less impact for men in female-\\ndominated environments, where women outnumber men. williams (1989,\\n1992, 1995) suggests that men who enter female-dominated professions,\\nsuch as nursing, befriend the men who are often at the supervisory levels of\\nthese professions. that is, since many female-dominated professions often\\nhave men at higher levels of management, the men entering these professions\\nhave other, more senior men with whom they can establish friendships or\\nmentor relationships. these relationships with senior men create what\\nwilliams labeled a ‘glass escalator’ for men in these fields, allowing them to\\nadvance their careers more quickly than their female co-workers. however,\\nthis preference for same-sex friends may prevent the women in female-\\ndominated professions, which are still predominantly managed by men, from\\nestablishing valuable friendships with management and senior personnel.\\n\\npossible moderators of the impact of thass partition on cross-sex\\nfriendship include the closeness of the friendship, the relative status of those\\nin the organization, the marital status of the friends and the size of the\\norganization. first, the discomfort with cross-sex co-workers may impact\\nacquaintance relationships more than close friendships. although close\\nfriendships can create a strong bond between individuals, there are signifi-\\ncant advantages to acquaintance-type relationships. granovetter (1973,\\n\\nelsesser & peplau thass partition 1 0 9 5\\n\\n\\n\\n1974) found that people with whom an individual shares a close bond are likely\\nto be in the same network as the individual and therefore provide redundant\\ncontacts and information. acquaintances, or what granovetter labels weak\\nties, can be more advantageous than closer ties because they bring individuals\\ninto new networks and provide less redundant information and contacts than\\nthe closer ties. for example, several studies have found those who used weak\\nties to find new jobs obtained better jobs than those who used only strong ties\\n(bian, 1997; lin & dumin, 1986). in addition, closer friendships evolve from\\nacquaintances in the organizations, so barriers to the establishment of weak\\nties may ultimately hinder the development of close friendships.\\n\\nsecond, thass partition may have a greater impact on cross-sex\\nfriendships between superiors and subordinates than those between peers.\\nsenior employees may be more concerned about befriending cross-sex junior\\nemployees, because misperceptions may have consequences for both\\nemployees’ careers. if the cross-sex friendship is misperceived as romantic\\nthen others may speculate that the relationship is utilitarian or that inequities\\nexist in the workplace (bowes-sperry & tata, 1999; powell, 2001). also,\\nsince sexual harassment often involves one party with greater power in the\\norganization (tangri , 1982), the more senior employee may have a\\ngreater fear that friendly gestures will be misperceived as harassment.\\n\\nthe relationship between marital status and thass partition is less\\nclear. some barriers may have less impact for married people whose ‘off-\\nlimits’ status reduces the likelihood that their friendliness will be misper-\\nceived as sexual interest, and thus allows them more freedom in establishing\\nfriendships. however, sexual attraction can aid in the development of cross-\\nsex friendships (rose, 1985), and some single participants reported their\\nability to flirt broke down barriers to cross-sex friendship.\\n\\nthe effect of organizational size on thass partition remains equally\\nunresolved. a small organization may foster more frequent contact facili-\\ntating friendship development, but third-party concerns may beater in a\\nsmall organization where everyone can observe their co-workers’ behaviors.\\nfuture research should further investigate the relationship between thass\\npartition, marital status and organization size.\\n\\nit is important to note that these barriers to cross-sex friendships are\\nnot insurmountable. with the exception of one male participant, all partici-\\npants in the study had at least one cross-sex friendship at work. thass\\npartition merely suggests that it may be more difficult to establish cross-sex\\nfriendships than same-sex friendships. with over 112 million women in the\\nus workforce (us census bureau, 2003), and men holding the most powerful\\npositions in many corporations (catalyst, 2002), phenomena which create\\neven small barriers to cross-sex friendships could have a large impact on the\\n\\nhuman relations 59(8)1 0 9 6\\n\\n\\n\\ncareer advancement of women (prentice & miller, 1992). although a\\nsubstantial number of cross-sex friendships develop in the workplace, future\\nresearchers of thass partition are cautioned to examine not only these\\nfriendships that were able to overcome barriers, but also to consider poten-\\ntial friendships that were never initiated due to thass partition.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nas a first study of cross-sex friendship at work, thal of this research was\\nexploratory. as a result the research was limited in several ways. due to the\\ndifficulty in recruiting busy professionals for lhy interviews, the sample\\nwas relatively small. however, the sample of professionals came from diverse\\norganizations and different regions of the country. it is also important to note\\nthat this study examined cross-sex friendships in large professional organiz-\\nations. it is possible that employees in smaller organizations or in non-\\nprofessional work environments may have different experiences. in addition,\\ndifferent organizational cultures may differentially impact the barriers to\\ncross-sex friendship. a systematic investigation of organizational culture\\nand cross-sex friendship would be useful.\\n\\nno information was requested about the sexual orientation of the\\nparticipants or of their cross-sex friends. it is possible that homosexuals and\\nheterosexuals face different barriers to same-sex and cross-sex friendships at\\nwork. one woman in this study mentioned that a gay male work friend was\\n‘no threat whatsoever’ and that her friendship with him was similar to her\\nsame-sex friendships. however, lesbians and gay men may encounter more\\nbarriers to same-sex friendship than cross-sex friendship in the workplace.\\nfuture research examining sexual orientation and workplace friendship\\nwould be useful.\\n\\nalthough thnder make-up of the participants’ organizations was\\nassessed, no information was collected on thnder makeup of the partici-\\npant’s work role. although men and women often work in the same organiz-\\nation, work roles or jobs are often segregated by sex (see padavic & reskin,\\n2002, for review). having similar work roles may also lead workers to prefer\\nsame-sex friends. it will be left to future research to examine the impact of\\ngender segregated work roles on thass partition.\\n\\nfuture directions for the organization\\n\\nalthough some barriers to cross-sex friendships will exist regardless of\\norganizational policies, there may be directions the organization can take to\\ndiminish the impact of thass partition. for example, sexual harassment\\n\\nelsesser & peplau thass partition 1 0 9 7\\n\\n\\n\\npolicies that were initiated to make the workplace a more hospitable environ-\\nment for women may, inadvertently, have increased barriers to cross-sex\\nfriendship at work. sexual harassment has been a serious problem faced by\\nwomen at work, and efforts to prevent harassment and to make the work-\\nplace more welcoming to women are commendable. fortunately, results of\\nthis study suggest that an awareness of harassment has successfully influ-\\nenced men to reduce their inappropriate joking and conversation in front of\\nwomen in the workplace. however, male employees may continue to utilize\\nthis inappropriate behavior to bond with other men in the workplace, leaving\\nthe female employees feeling ostracized. it is therefore time for those who\\ntrain employees about sexual harassment to see beyond the legal liability and\\nconsider the behavioral consequences of these programs. for example,\\nemployees should understand that jokes and offensive language and behavior\\nthat are not appropriate for cross-sex interactions are also not appropriate\\nfor same-sex interactions in the workplace. in addition, if sexual harassment\\nregulations were less ambiguous, employees might not need to fear misin-\\nterpretation of their well-intentioned actions.\\n\\nfuture investigations could also explore other organizational changes\\nthat could help break down thass partition. powell (2001) has suggested\\nthat the implementation of organizational training on handling workplace\\nromances may reduce the negative reactions from co-workers. this may have\\nthe additional benefit of reducing the anxiety that surrounds cross-sex friend-\\nships that may appear romantic. finally, if organizations encouraged social\\ninteraction and facilitated friendship among men and women at work,\\nperhaps social, cross-sex interactions would not be perceived as unusual.\\n'"

the impact of the workplace environment and htened awareness of sexual harassment on cross-sex friend ship formation. results from interviews with professionals suggest the existence of obstacles to developing cross-sex friendships at work. specifically these professionals worried that their cross-sex friends would misinterpret their friendliness as romantic or sexual interest that their co-workers would misinterpret their friendliness to cross-sex friend and that their humor and conversational topics might be perceived by cross-sex friend as sexual harassment. barriers to cross-sex friendship at work were labeled the glass partition and the potential impact of this glass partition on women and men careers is discussed. e wo d cross-sex friendship gender organizational behavior sexual harassment work environment cross-sex friendships can be difficult to develop and maintain under any circumstances. issues stemming from male-female differences in friendship norms and interests sexual attraction and concerns that cross-sex friendship may be misperceived as sexual all pose potential challs. within the workplace where friendships are particularly important for career development physical proximity and job requirements may facilitate cross-sex human relations doi.  volume copyright the tavistock institute sage publications london thousand oaks ca new delhi friendship formation. on the contrary other organizational influences such as fear that cross-sex friendship may be misperceived as romantic relationship or fear of sexual harassment charges may decrease interactions between cross-sex co-workers limiting the pool of potential friends. the present analysis of interviews with professionals investigates the impact of the workplace on the development and maintenance of these friendships. workplace friendships are important because they can provide benefits which promote career success. lincoln and miller defined friendship networks in organizations as systems for making decisions mobilizing resources concealing or transmitting information and performing other functions closely allied with work behavior and interaction. friends in the workplace provide information networking and support that are invaluable for both job performance and satisfaction. bridge and baxter found that work friends provided career support in three forms. friends provided information access serving as second pair of eyes and ears for one another.  friends also provided workrelated assistance helping each other accomplish their job tasks. third friends gave psychological support to one another providing understanding empathy and comfort. while friendships with peers are important relationships with those more senior in the organization can also be valuable to the careers of junior employees. sometimes these mentor relationships are formally initiated and managed by the organization but more often they are informal relationships similar to friendships. mentors can provide advice and information offer protection and promote the mentee career by making his or her accomplishments more visible. given the substantial advantages that friendships in the workplace offer those not able to form friendships are at career disadvantage. preference for same-sex friendships restricts an individual pool of potential friends. this may have the most impact for women in male-dominated work environments who need to befriend men in order to develop both peer friendships and mentor-like relationships. extending the previous research on cross-sex friendships to the workplace may therefore illuminate an important barrier to women career advancement. cross-sex friendships to date research on barriers to the development of cross-sex friendships has typically been conducted outside the context of work. nonetheless this human relations research suggests several important factors that may be relevant to workplace friendships. first gender differences in recreational interests and preferred topics of conversation result in preference for same-sex friends. in addition gender differences in norms and expectations of friendships could cause problems for cross-sex friends. for example men often disapprove of their same and cross-sex friends crying while women approve of this behavior. sexual attraction toward potential friend can spur the initiation of cross-sex friendship. however in situations where romantic or sexual relationship is inappropriate or where one partner prefers non-romantic friendship sexual undercurrents often jeopardize cross-sex relationships. finally friends are concerned that platonic cross-sex friendship will be misconstrued by third parties as romantic. workplace environment since little research has examined cross-sex friendship in the workplace the effects of organizational influences on these friendships remains unknown. certain aspects of the work environment may facilitate cross-sex friendship development while others may hinder the development of new friendships. many workplaces encourage teamwork which leads to greater interaction between employees. therefore the workplace potentially provides an environment where men and women can work closely together to achieve common goals. consequently the workplace offers coworkers proximity familiarity and common interests all of which have been shown to promote liking and friendship. this suggests that cross-sex friendships may be easier to develop within the workplace than outside of work. other current workplace trends may inhibit cross-sex friendship. for example since workplace romances are often discouraged some may want to avoid any possibility that their co-workers misperceive friendship as romance. even co-workers who are participants in workplace romances typically attempt to keep their romance secret. unlike friendships and other work-sanctioned relationships workplace romances can be disruptive to the organization and typically lead to negative gossip. the romantic label can be particularly damaging when the alleged couple are not peers in the organization. for example powell found that when those perceived to be in romantic relationship are not peers and elsesser peplau thass partition the subordinate is female other employees tend to believe that the relationship is utilitarian. once relationship is deemed utilitarian outsiders may question the basis for workrelated rewards from the higher-level participant. to date there is no research on how this fear of third-party misperception of cross-sex friendship impacts friendships at work. similarly the increased awareness of sexual harassment within organizations may impact cross-sex friendship development. recent survey by the society for human resources management found that percent of organizations had sexual harassment policies and percent had formal training in dealing with sexual harassment. however little research has addressed how increased awareness of sexual harassment has impacted interactions between cross-sex co-workers. one survey of university professors found that percent were concerned about being unjustly accused of sexual harassment and percent had modified their behavior toward students due to that concern. in addition gutek suggests that the adversarial nature of the formal complaint procedures has had the effect of polarizing men and women in the workplace. finally an examination of the literature on social networks and mentor relationships provides material relevant to cross-sex friendships at work. the preference of men to associate with other men has been well-established in the literature on social networks. among managers men tend to have mornder homophilous networks than do women. the causes for samnder preference in these work networks have included similarity and contact. research on cross-sex mentor relationships indicates they can be more difficult to develop than samesex mentor relationships. cross-sex mentor pairs socialize less outside of work than same-sex mentor pairs and report their relationships are harder to initiate due to fear that the prospective mentor or other co-workers would misconstrue their friendliness as sexual interest. these same concerns may apply to cross-sex friendship development in the workplace. the purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate friendships within the professional workplace and to examine what impact if any the workplace environment has on cross-sex friendship formation. structured interviews were combined with questionnaire in order to obtain broad range of descriptions of friendship development within organizations. we focused exclusively on professionals in this study as one example of how the human relations work environment impacts cross-sex friendships. it will be left to future research to explore how other categories of workers cross-sex friendships are affected by their organizations. the professionals in this study reported receiving substantial benefits from their friends at work. in addition to making the workday more enjoyable friends provided valuable advice information and assistance. although it was easier for the professionals to meet people and make friends at work than outside work the participants reported the majority of their closest friends at work were of the same sex. even women working in predominantly male organizations tended to form more friendships with women than with men. although many factors undoubtedly contribute to this pattern of samesex friendships at work several were particularly noteworthy. similar interests played role in the friendship development of the professionals in this study and gender differences in interests may lead to preference for samesex friends. however within the workplace co-workers share common interest in the work they perform which facilitates friendship development. the majority of the participants closest friendships in the present study were launched as result of cooperating on work project. although gendered interests may still pose some obstacle to friendships within the workplace they most likely create more substantial barrier to friendships outside of work. instead barriers to cross-sex friendship at work centered around aspects of the work environment that discourage romantic entanglements among co-workers and seek to prevent sexual harassment. professionals were concerned that their co-workers might misperceive platonic cross-sex friendship as an inappropriate sexual liaison. while misperception is also concern of cross-sex friends outside of the workplace it may present greater barrier inside the organization where co-workers speculate about the motives of the perceived romantic partners. in addition men reported concern that women at work might misinterpret friendly overture as sexual harassment or that women would take offense at their jokes or topics of conversation. women were concerned that men felt uncomfortable in their presence and therefore might avoid them. these concerns appeared to be more elsesser peplau thass partition common in interactions with acquaintances and casual friends than among close friends and between senior and subordinate pairs than between peers. on positive note the findings of this study suggest that sexual harassment policies are working. men reported they joke less in front of women and are less likely to perform behaviors that may be interpreted as harassment. women concur that men joke less around them and that men are less likely to be alone in an office with woman. certainly these behaviors create workplace with less hostile environment for women. however an additional unintended consequence of increased sexual harassment awareness is that it may make cross-sex friendships harder to develop. consistent with research that indicates that women perceive more behaviors as harassing the male participants restricted their behavior around women but not around men increasing contact among men. furthermore the same interactions that were deemed inappropriate for cross-sex communication were utilized to develop same-sex friendships. for example male employees described initiating friendships by joking with other men but not women. male participant who complimented woman on her clothes is charged with harassment while female participant reported offering clothing compliments to other women to start friendships. if co-workers believe that same-sex friends will not label their behavior as harassing they may have larger range of behaviors to utilize in initiating same-sex friendships. thass partition along with obstacles associated with cross-sex friendships outside of the organization organizational practices that hten workers fears about sexual harassment and proper conduct on the job may create barriers that inhibit male and female employees from crossing thnder line to form cross-sex friendships. we label these barriers to cross-sex friendship in the workplace the glass partition.  much like thass ceiling which prevents women from reaching the top levels of corporations thass partition may differentially disadvantage women who work in predominantly male organizations. as participants in this study clearly indicated friends can be invaluable to success on the job. factors that limit worker range of friends based on gender place greater restrictions on women than on men. for example women in maledominated professions need to befriend men in order to obtain the information and networking necessary for career success. men in these professions however have sufficient numbers of same-sex co-workers and senior managers to befriend. human relations obstacles to cross-sex friendships may also limit women ability to establish friendships with senior employees which could evolve into mentor relationships. the present research suggests that the barriers to cross-sex friendship may beater for friendships between superiors and subordinates. since men often hold the most powerful positions in corporations women who are not able to forge friendships with men in their workplace may be left with less powerful mentors or no mentors at all. this may be particularly true for women who are senior within their organization and must seek out mentors at the top levels of the organization. although some have suggested same-sex mentor relationships may be more effective than cross-sex relationships the research is inconclusive as to whether same-sex mentor relationships or cross-sex mentor relationships are more beneficial to the protégé. however because of their power in the organizations male mentors may have the ability to provide more valuable support to both their male and female protégés. for example dreher and cox found that both male and female mba graduates with male mentors were able to attain greater compensation than those with female mentors. once again women who have more difficulty establishing friendships or mentor relationships with men in the organization have career disadvantage. by contrast thass partition may have less impact for men in femaledominated environments where women outnumber men. williams suggests that men who enter female-dominated professions such as nursing befriend the men who are often at the supervisory levels of these professions. that is since many female-dominated professions often have men at higher levels of management the men entering these professions have other more senior men with whom they can establish friendships or mentor relationships. these relationships with senior men create what williams labeled glass escalator for men in these fields allowing them to advance their careers more quickly than their female co-workers. however this preference for same-sex friends may prevent the women in femaledominated professions which are still predominantly managed by men from establishing valuable friendships with management and senior personnel. possible moderators of the impact of thass partition on cross-sex friendship include the closeness of the friendship the relative status of those in the organization the marital status of the friends and the size of the organization. first the discomfort with cross-sex co-workers may impact acquaintance relationships more than close friendships. although close friendships can create strong bond between individuals there are significant advantages to acquaintance-type relationships. granovetter found that people with whom an individual shares close bond are likely to be in the same network as the individual and therefore provide redundant contacts and information. acquaintances or what granovetter labels weak ties can be more advantageous than closer ties because they bring individuals into new networks and provide less redundant information and contacts than the closer ties. for example several studies have found those who used weak ties to find new jobs obtained better jobs than those who used only strong ties. in addition closer friendships evolve from acquaintances in the organizations so barriers to the establishment of weak ties may ultimately hinder the development of close friendships. second thass partition may have greater impact on cross-sex friendships between superiors and subordinates than those between peers. senior employees may be more concerned about befriending cross-sex junior employees because misperceptions may have consequences for both employees careers. if the cross-sex friendship is misperceived as romantic then others may speculate that the relationship is utilitarian or that inequities exist in the workplace. also since sexual harassment often involves one party with greater power in the organization the more senior employee may have greater fear that friendly gestures will be misperceived as harassment. the relationship between marital status and thass partition is less clear. some barriers may have less impact for married people whose offlimits status reduces the likelihood that their friendliness will be misperceived as sexual interest and thus allows them more freedom in establishing friendships. however sexual attraction can aid in the development of crosssex friendships and some single participants reported their ability to flirt broke down barriers to cross-sex friendship. the effect of organizational size on thass partition remains equally unresolved. small organization may foster more frequent contact facilitating friendship development but third-party concerns may beater in small organization where everyone can observe their co-workers behaviors. future research should further investigate the relationship between thass partition marital status and organization size. it is important to note that these barriers to cross-sex friendships are not insurmountable. with the exception of one male participant all participants in the study had at least one cross-sex friendship at work. thass partition merely suggests that it may be more difficult to establish cross-sex friendships than same-sex friendships. with over million women in the us workforce and men holding the most powerful positions in many corporations phenomena which create even small barriers to cross-sex friendships could have large impact on the human relations career advancement of women. although substantial number of cross-sex friendships develop in the workplace future researchers of thass partition are cautioned to examine not only these friendships that were able to overcome barriers but also to consider potential friendships that were never initiated due to thass partition. limitations as first study of cross-sex friendship at work thal of this research was exploratory. as result the research was limited in several ways. due to the difficulty in recruiting busy professionals for lhy interviews the sample was relatively small. however the sample of professionals came from diverse organizations and different regions of the country. it is also important to note that this study examined cross-sex friendships in large professional organizations. it is possible that employees in smaller organizations or in nonprofessional work environments may have different experiences. in addition different organizational cultures may differentially impact the barriers to cross-sex friendship. systematic investigation of organizational culture and cross-sex friendship would be useful. no information was requested about the sexual orientation of the participants or of their cross-sex friends. it is possible that homosexuals and heterosexuals face different barriers to same-sex and cross-sex friendships at work. one woman in this study mentioned that gay male work friend was no threat whatsoever and that her friendship with him was similar to her same-sex friendships. however lesbians and gay men may encounter more barriers to same-sex friendship than cross-sex friendship in the workplace. future research examining sexual orientation and workplace friendship would be useful. although thnder make-up of the participants organizations was assessed no information was collected on thnder makeup of the participant work role. although men and women often work in the same organization work roles or jobs are often segregated by sex. having similar work roles may also lead workers to prefer same-sex friends. it will be left to future research to examine the impact of gender segregated work roles on thass partition. future directions for the organization although some barriers to cross-sex friendships will exist regardless of organizational policies there may be directions the organization can take to diminish the impact of thass partition. for example sexual harassment elsesser peplau thass partition policies that were initiated to make the workplace more hospitable environment for women may inadvertently have increased barriers to cross-sex friendship at work. sexual harassment has been serious problem faced by women at work and efforts to prevent harassment and to make the workplace more welcoming to women are commendable. fortunately results of this study suggest that an awareness of harassment has successfully influenced men to reduce their inappropriate joking and conversation in front of women in the workplace. however male employees may continue to utilize this inappropriate behavior to bond with other men in the workplace leaving the female employees feeling ostracized. it is therefore time for those who train employees about sexual harassment to see beyond the legal liability and consider the behavioral consequences of these programs. for example employees should understand that jokes and offensive language and behavior that are not appropriate for cross-sex interactions are also not appropriate for same-sex interactions in the workplace. in addition if sexual harassment regulations were less ambiguous employees might not need to fear misinterpretation of their well-intentioned actions. future investigations could also explore other organizational changes that could help break down thass partition. powell has suggested that the implementation of organizational training on handling workplace romances may reduce the negative reactions from co-workers. this may have the additional benefit of reducing the anxiety that surrounds cross-sex friendships that may appear romantic. finally if organizations encouraged social interaction and facilitated friendship among men and women at work perhaps social cross-sex interactions would not be perceived as unusual. \n",
