grinblatt & han, 2005; hardie, john-\\nson, & fader, 1993; heath, huddart, & lang, 1999; heath, larrick, &\\nwu, 1999; keasey & moon, 1996; mas, 2006). an important pre-\\nmise of these applications of prospect theory is that reference\\npoints shift over time, but only recently have scholars started to\\nexplore systematically the dynamic properties of reference points.\\nfurthermore, research that examines such properties across differ-\\nent cultures is almost non-existent. given the large body of re-\\nsearch showing that culture affects individual judgment and\\ndecisions, a primary purpose of this manuscript was to ascertain\\nwhether reference point adaptation exhibits cross-cultural varia-\\ntions, and if so, what are the possible causes of these variations.\\nll rights reserved.\\n\\nuthor contributed fully and\\n\\nychology, ohio state univer-\\nnited states. fax: +1 614 688\\na natural hypothesis for the dynamics of reference point adapta-\\ntion is that the reference point moves in a manner consistent with\\nthe prior outcome, shifting upward following a gain and downward\\nfollowing a loss. using subjects from the us, arkes, hirshleifer, jiang,\\nand lim (2008) found that reference points adapt asymmetrically:\\nsuch adaptation was significantly larger following a gain than fol-\\nlowing a loss.1 they also found that when the initial paper gain or loss\\nis realized, adaptation both to losses and gains appeared to be en-\\nhanced. the current paper applied the measurement approach of\\narkes  to encompass both east-asian and us subjects. in addition,\\nwe employed two additional questionnaire designs to estimate refer-\\nence points. in all approaches we identified both cross-cultural simi-\\nlarities and differences in reference point adaptation.\\n\\nperforming cross-cultural studies in reference point adaptation\\nwas motivated by recent research that has documented important\\ndifferences in several judgment and decision making phenomena\\nacross countries. east-asians, who live in collectivist societies, ex-\\nhibit behavioral differences in many aspects from americans, who\\nlive in an individualist society. research has shown that, relative to\\namericans, east-asians appear to be more overconfident (yates,\\nlee, & shinotsuka, 1996), more risk seeking in the financial domain\\n(hsee & weber, 1999), more holistic than analytic, more likely to\\n1 in a somewhat similar spirit, strahilevitz and loewenstein (1998) conjectured\\nthat ‘‘. . . adaptation to losses takes longer than adaptation to gains and would\\ntherefore require a greater time interval to observe.”\\n\\n\\nmailto:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfig. 1.

rather than to internal factors\\n(morris & p 1994), more prone to detect stronger associations\\nbetween events and apt to place less value on having personal con-\\ntrol (ji, p & nisbett, 2000), and more likely to expect that\\nchanges that have occurred in the past will reverse in the future\\n(ji, nisbett, & su, 2001). all of these factors represent potential\\ninfluences on the determination of reference points.\\n\\ncross-cultural study of reference point adaptation can help us\\nto understand the potential sources of variations in financial mar-\\nket behavior across the world. scholars have used prospect theory\\nto understand a number of anomalous stock market phenomena,\\nincluding excess volatility, the equity premium puzzle, the value\\neffect, the momentum effect, the disposition effect, and ipo under-\\nperformance (, barberis & huang, 2001; barberis & xiong, 2009;\\nbernartzi & thaler, 1995; shefrin & statman, 1985). there is evi-\\ndence that the high equity premium, the value effect, the momen-\\ntum effect, and the disposition effect are present outside the\\nunited states to varying extents.2 the issue of reference point\\nupdating is potentially important for applications of prospect theory\\nto these empirical findings.\\nmotivation and literature review\\n\\nreference point adaptation in prospect theory\\n\\nkahneman and tversky (1979) proposed prospect theory as an\\nalternative to the normative theory of expected utility maximiza-\\ntion. there are three main elements of prospect theory: first, peo-\\nple derive utility from gains and losses relative to a reference point,\\nwhile traditional utility theory assumes that people derive utility\\nfrom total wealth or consumption. although the reference point\\nis generally one’s current wealth (kahneman & tversky, 1979),\\naspiration levels or norms can also serve this function (heath,\\nlarrick, , 1999; kahneman & tversky, 1979, p. 286). second,\\nthe value function is concave in the domain of gains and convex\\nin the domain of losses. the shape of the function captures ‘‘dual\\nrisk attitudes”: individuals tend to be risk averse in thin do-\\nmain but risk seeking in the loss domain. third, the effect of a loss\\non utility is much larger than that of a gain of the same size (‘‘loss\\naversion”).\\n\\nprospect theory has most commonly been applied to static deci-\\nsion environments. in dynamic applications such as stock trading,\\n2 , fama and french (1998), rouwenhorst (1998), grinblatt and keloharju\\n(2001), chui, titman, and wei (2010), fand seasholes (2005), and dimson, marsh,\\n& staunton (2008).\\nrepeated bargaining and negotiation, work efforts, and firm invest-\\nments, it is important to understand how reference points are up-\\ndated after individuals experience outcomes over time.\\n\\nconsider the prospect theory value function depicted in fig. 1. if\\na loss has occurred, the decision maker is at point l in fig. 1a. if a\\nsubsequent decision is to be made and the reference point has not\\nadapted to the initial loss, the decision maker will likely be risk\\nseeking, in that a further loss will cause only a small decrease on\\nthe y-axis, whereas a further gain will result in a larger increase.\\nhowever if the decision maker adapts fully to the initial loss, then\\nfig. 1b depicts this situation. now the decision maker will be less\\nrisk seeking, because the ‘‘re-centering” of the origin of thaph\\non the current state of affairs causes a loss to be more painful than\\nit would have been in fig. 1a. thus, if the reference point does not\\nbudge following a loss, then the decision maker is likely to become\\nrisk seeking and to try to recover the loss, leading to such phenom-\\nena as the sunk cost effect (arkes & blumer, 1985) or the disposi-\\ntion effect (shefrin & statman, 1985). on the other hand, if the\\nreference point adapts downward following a loss, the decision\\nmaker is able to ‘‘make peace” with this loss and will be less likely\\nto ‘‘throw good money after bad.”\\n\\nthere are a very few cross-cultural studies pertaining to the sta-\\ntic aspects of prospect theory. however, we know of no cross-cul-\\ntural research on its dynamic aspects, which are the focus of our\\nstudy. there are a very few studies testing the dynamic aspects\\nof prospect theory using us subjects. using both hypothetical out-\\ncomes depicted in questionnaire studies and monetary outcomes\\nfrom a coin-toss game, chen and rao (2002) found that the order\\nin which two equal but opposite events (gain/loss) occurred af-\\nfected the subject’s final affective state, suggesting that a shift in\\nthe reference point must have occurred after the first event. they\\nalso found that adding a time lapse between the two events gener-\\nated results consistent with greater shift in reference points. how-\\never, their method does not allow estimates of the location of new\\nreference points. gneezy (2005) endowed subjects with a stock\\nand then queried them about their willingness to hold or sell it\\nas its price varied over several trading periods. gneezy assumed\\nthat subjects are most willing to sell when the current price is\\nequal to the reference point, and showed that assuming a stock’s\\npeak price to be the reference point best explained subjects’ will-\\ningness to sell that stock. gneezy’s method can position the refer-\\nence point relative to prior stock prices only when the subject sells\\nthe stock. baucells, weber, and welfens (2010) estimated the ref-\\nerence point by asking subjects which selling price would make\\nthem neither happy nor unhappy after they observed a stock price\\npath. by regressing the reference point indicated by the subject on\\nthe purchase price, the current price, and the intermediate prices,\\nbaucells  showed that the reference point is most heavily\\ninfluenced by the first and the last observed stock price.\\n\\nall of these studies suggest that reference points are path-\\ndependent: past prices, in addition to the purchase price, appear\\nto have significant impacts on the current reference point. this im-\\nplies that reference points adapt to outcome payoffs. however,\\nthese studies do not estimate the exact magnitude of reference\\npoint adaptation after a gain or loss. they therefore do not allow\\ncomparative analyses such as the test of gain-loss asymmetry.\\n\\narkes  (2008) estimated the changes in reference point\\nlocation following stock trading gains and losses using both ques-\\ntionnaires and real money incentives. they found that the refer-\\nence point adapts to prior gains to a greater extent than to prior\\nlosses using two main procedures, which we adopted and will ex-\\nplain in detail in the current studies 1 and 3. also, when subjects\\nwere forced to sell a stock and then repurchase it at the same price\\nat which it had been sold (weber & camerer, 1998), arkes \\nfound that reference point adaptation was accelerated; reference\\npoints moved closer towards the new purchase price.\\n\\n\\n\\nh.r. arkes  / organizational behavior and human decision processes 112 (2010) 99–111 101\\ncross-cultural differences in decision making\\n\\nweber and hsee (1998) and hsee and weber (1999) showed\\nthat chinese are less risk averse than americans in their financial\\ndecisions, but not in other domains such as medical and academic\\ndecisions. weber and hsee (1998) found that, under a general risk-\\nreturn framework, the perception of the riskiness of financial\\ninvestment options is lower among chinese than americans, and\\nargue that this difference in risk perception can explain cross-cul-\\ntural differences in risk preferences. hsee and weber (1999) sug-\\ngest that chinese are less risk averse because a financial\\n‘‘cushion” that is available in a collectivist culture makes chinese\\nless afraid of risk. consistent with this hypothesis, they found that\\nthe cross-cultural differences between the chinese and americans\\nin perceived financial risks became insignificant once they con-\\ntrolled for social network variables, such as the number of people\\nan individual could rely on for financial assistance.\\n\\nji  (2001) documented greater expectation of reversals by\\nasians than americans. in five studies, ji  (2001) showed that\\nchinese students were more likely to predict change from an initial\\ntrend than were americans. in the research mostly closely related\\nto our studies, ji, zhang, and guo (2008) presented north american\\nand chinese subjects – both college students and experienced\\ninvestors – with graphs illustrating upward, downward, or stable\\nprice trends of various stocks. compared to the north american\\nsubjects, the chinese participants were more likely to buy stocks\\nwhose prices were decreasing and sell stocks whose prices were\\nincreasing. protocol analyses indicated that this contrarian ten-\\ndency on the part of the chinese was due to their belief that a\\nchange was likely in the future. thus, compared to americans, chi-\\nnese subjects – or asian subjects in general – might be more likely\\nto predict that gains would be followed by losses, and conversely.\\nany such difference would have important implications for the val-\\nuation and willingness to continue holding a stock following an ini-\\ntial price movement.\\n\\nin this paper, we employed the experimental designs used in\\narkes  (2008) and two additional methods to infer reference\\npoints. we have four goals in mind. first, we measured reference\\npoint adaptation among east-asians to ascertain if theater adap-\\ntation to gains than losses was present across cultures, as was doc-\\numented among us participants in arkes  (2008). second, we\\nexamined if there is a cross-cultural difference in the magnitude\\nof reference point adaptation between east-asians and americans.\\nthird, we ascertained whether the intervention of the sale and\\nrepurchase of stocks accelerated reference point adaptation in the\\nasian culture, as was previously demonstrated in the american\\nsample. finally, we explored the possible explanations for the ob-\\nserved cross-cultural variation in reference point adaptation.\\n3 the exchange rate between the us dollar and korea won is close to the ratio of\\nthe purchasing powers of two currencies. however, there is a discrepancy between\\nthe exchange rate and the purchasing power ratio for the us dollars and china ¥. for\\ninstance, an equivalent mcdonald meal or an hour of math tutoring costs roughly 2–3\\ntimes more in the us than in china. therefore, for the chinese subjects we made an\\nadjustment to their prize based on the relative price of a mcdonald meal or payment\\nfor tutoring services in the two markets. this strategy ensured similar incentives from\\nthe perspective of an average subject across all countries.\\nstudy 1: questionnaire study of reference point adaptation\\nfollowing arkes  (2008)\\n\\nin this questionnaire study we asked subjects to indicate a stock\\nprice today that would generate the same utility as a previous stock\\nprice change. assume that the first stock price p1 resulted in a level\\nof utility v(p1 � r0), which is a function of the difference between\\nthe first stock price p1 and the reference point r0. subjects indicate\\nthe price of the stock today p� that would generate the same utility\\nas the previous price. assuming a constant shape of the prospect va-\\nlue function, we have v(p� � r1) = v(p1 � r0). thus the distance be-\\ntween the indicated stock price and the new reference point must\\nbe equal to the distance between the prior stock price and the old\\nreference point: p� � r1 = p1 � r0. so the reference point adaptation\\nr1 � r0 = p� � p1. that is, reference point adaptation can be inferred\\nfrom the subject’s indication of the stock price today that would\\ngenerate the same utility as the previous price change.\\n\\nthere were three main results in our studies. first, the asym-\\nmetric adaptation found in american students by arkes \\n(2008) was also found in the asian participants as well as our\\ntable 5\\nmean reference point adaptation: base and intervention (study 5).\\n\\ngain\\n(base)\\n\\nloss\\n(base)\\n\\ngain\\n(intervention)\\n\\nloss\\n(intervention)\\n\\nasia 4.05 0.43 4.69 1.44\\n(n = 59) (n = 67)\\n\\nus 1.65 1.12 4.89 2.66\\n(n = 76) (n = 93)\\n\\ntotal 2.70 0.82 4.81 2.15\\n\\nnote: each subject answered either the base case scenarios or the intervention\\nscenarios.\\nnew us subjects. thus this result appears to generalize across\\ncultures.\\n\\nthe asymmetric adaptation to gains and losses, according to\\narkes  (2008), can be caused by fundamental hedonic pro-\\ncesses. specifically, faster adaptation to gains than to losses results\\nfrom hedonic benefits of segregating intertemporal gains and inte-\\ngrating intertemporal losses (thaler, 1985, 1999).\\n\\nafter a gain, updating the reference point modestly upward to\\ncapture part of thin generates an immediate hedonic benefit\\nfrom recognizing thin, at the cost of reducing any remaining\\ngains to be experienced. however the increase in the immediate\\ngain from 0 is in the steep portion of the value function, whereas\\nthe reduction in futurins is from a gently sloping part of the va-\\nlue function. so due to the concavity of the value function within\\nthe region of gains, this is a net utility increase. for losses, simi-\\nlarly, recognizing part of a loss immediately has an immediate he-\\ndonic cost, and by the convexity of the value function in the realm\\nof losses, this cost outws the benefit of reducing future losses.\\nso no updating is preferred to updating after losses. while the he-\\ndonic maximization suggests a partial adaptation after a gain and\\nno adaptation after a loss, the sense of reality is likely to encourage\\nadaptation toward the current state in both directions. therefore\\nwe are likely to see some extent of adaptation in both directions,\\nwith a greater adaptation after a gain than after a loss.\\n\\nthal of such ‘‘affective neering” is hedonic maximiza-\\ntion. we hypothesize that culture would have a minimal role to\\nplay in the pursuit of this goal. thus we expect to observe asym-\\nmetric adaptation to gains and losses in all countries.\\n\\nthe second main finding was that, without the sales and repur-\\nchase intervention, adaptation to prior outcomes was greater\\namong asians than among americans. this result may be caused\\nby different impacts of culture on balancing the two forces deter-\\nmining the new reference point—recognizing the current state\\nand deviating from it in order to maximize hedonic utility.\\n\\nwe conjecture that there are two culture-related reasons that\\ninfluence this balance. first, faster adaptation among asians can\\nbe attributed to the smaller loss aversion among asians that\\nencourages greater adaptation to increase hedonic utility. based\\non the model of reference point updating explained above, smaller\\nloss aversion facilitates adaptation to a loss since segregation of a\\nprior loss is now less painful. it also encourages adaptation to a\\ngain since it reduces the negative impact of a possible subsequent\\nloss; updating of the reference point means that a subsequent loss\\nwill occur in the flatter portion of thin function rather than in\\nthe relatively steep portion close to the origin of thaph where a\\nperson would be if no updating had occurred.8\\n\\nsecond, cross-cultural research has shown that in many respects\\neast-asians hold a fundamentally different viewpoint than ameri-\\ncans (, nisbett, 2004), a viewpoint which might encourage\\nasians to move the new reference point closer to the current stock\\nprice than americans would do. east-asians view the world as com-\\nplex and highly changeable with interrelated components where\\nindividuals are less able to impact the course of an event. in con-\\ntrast, americans view the world consisting of discrete, indepen-\\ndent, and stable objects where each individual is in control of\\ntheir own behavior and the consequence of such behavior (ji\\n, 2000). such viewpoints lead to asians’ more malleable and\\namericans’ more stable preferences and personalities (norenzayan,\\n8 it was suggested that cross-cultural differences in reference point adaptation\\nmight be caused by cultural differences in the cognitive ability of the subjects. in an\\nunreported study using us participants (available upon request), we found no\\nsignificant relationship between the magnitude/asymmetry of reference point\\nadaptation and a measure of cognitive ability (frederick, 2005). therefore a difference\\nin cognitive ability is unlikely to be responsible for the cultural differences we report\\nhere\\n\\n\\n\\n108 h.r. arkes  / organizational behavior and human decision processes 112 (2010) 99–111\\nchoi, & nisbett, 2002). as hsu (1981, p. 13) noted, ‘‘the chinese\\ntends to mobilize his thought and action for the purpose of con-\\nforming to the reality, while the american tends to do so for the\\npurpose of making the reality conform to him.” these cultural dif-\\nferences suggest that, in the tradeoff between conforming to reality\\nand hedonic maximization that involves personal control, asians\\nare likely to be dictated by the former while americans by the lat-\\nter. thus, reference points tend to adapt more readily among asians\\nthan among americans.\\n\\nas for the third finding, the insertion of the stock sale interven-\\ntion facilitated adaptation in the us significantly more than that in\\nthe two asian countries. this cross-cultural difference is reflected\\nin a chinese proverb, ‘‘a good fortune may forebode bad luck,\\nwhich may in turn disguise a good fortune,” that describes the be-\\nlief of chinese in reversals. this effect is particularly strong in stud-\\nies 3 and 4, where asians’ reference point adaptation is decreased\\nwhen the intervention is introduced while that of americans is in-\\ncreased. in study 5, however, the intervention slightly increased\\nthe adaptation of asians while increasing adaptation of americans\\nto a greater extent. in other words, although the intervention\\ncaused greater adaptation in the americans – again replicating\\narkes  (2008) – it had a much milder, sometimes an opposite\\neffect, among asians. we hypothesize that two factors are respon-\\nsible for this result.\\n\\nthe first factor is the one that motivated the use of this inter-\\nvention. arkes  (2008) hypothesized that by having the subject\\nsell the stock and realize the paper gain/loss, the new price at\\nwhich their gain or loss occurs becomes more salient. this encour-\\nages adaptation from the original price toward that new price at\\nwhich the sale and new purchase occurs. indeed, that is what hap-\\npened in the american sample in arkes  (2008) and consis-\\ntently occurs to our american sample in this manuscript.\\n\\nthe second factor is discussed by ji, p  (2000) and ji,\\nnisbett,  (2001). ji, p  (2000) showed that compared\\nto americans, asians thought that there were stronger associations\\nbetween objects, consistent with the notion that east-asians pay\\nmore attention to the field and the interaction between objects.\\nin contrast, americans viewed objects as more independent identi-\\nties. in our experimental setting the two outcomes – one being the\\nprior outcome payoff and the other being the new gain or loss –\\nmay be viewed by americans as relatively independent. thus, the\\noutcome payoff in the old mental account becomes distant and less\\nrelevant once the new mental account is established, with the new\\npurchase price serving as a salient cue for the new reference point.\\nin contrast, while east-asians may also close the old and open the\\nnew mental account to some extent, they are likely to feel the tug\\nof the prior reference point more than the americans would and\\nnot dismiss it as an independent and irrelevant separate entity.\\n\\ndepending how a scenario is framed and presented, a strong\\ncontrarian view in prediction among asians can be triggered. ji\\n (2001) demonstrated in a very wide variety of assessment\\ntasks that chinese persons, to a significantly greater extent than\\namericans, anticipated that circumstances would change. for\\nexample, chinese subjects, more than americans, expected a chess\\nchampion to lose the next match, bickering children to eventually\\nbecome lovers, and dating couples to break up. ji  (2008)\\nshowed that this contrarian tendency also applied strongly to chi-\\nnese participants’ beliefs about future stock prices. such a belief\\nwould foster exactly the results we obtained, namely less adapta-\\ntion to the new price when it is emphasized via a sale and new pur-\\nchase manipulation. this is due to the fact that in our experimental\\nsetting the sale intervention makes that outcome more salient and\\nthus more strongly triggers the contrarian prediction of asians. if\\nthe first price change is positive, asian participants will have a\\nsomewhat greater expectation of an adverse outcome. therefore,\\nthey will be unwilling to adapt their reference point upward sub-\\nstantially; by adapting sluggishly, they add a cushion to their men-\\ntal account against theater possibility of a future loss. in the\\ncase with a prior loss, asians will expect a greater likelihood of a\\nfuturin. by adapting less aggressively to the prior loss, asians\\nwill anticipate this futurin and use part of it to offset part of\\nthe prior loss. thus we expect asian subjects to adapt less to either\\nprior outcome than americans after a sale and new purchase inter-\\nvention, due to the contrarian tendency demonstrated by ji \\n(2008).\\n\\nwithin the stock trading experiment in study 3, subjects were\\ninformed of possible up and down states of future prices. in sce-\\nnario ii of study 4 subjects were presented in thin frame, for\\nexample, with no change in the $50 price from the first to the\\nsecond period and then a gain to $55 for the third period ($50–\\n$50–$55). subjects also read scenario i in which there was a gain\\nfrom $50 to $60 from the first to the second period. they were\\nthen asked what price during the third period of scenario i would\\nmake then just as happy as the third period price of $55 in sce-\\nnario ii ($50–$60–?). to answer this question subjects would\\nhave to consider the possibility of a reversal, that is, a lowering\\nof the third period price in scenario i. by presenting cues of a\\npossible future price reversal, we hypothesize that the contrarian\\npredilection of asians is likely to be strhened under either\\nthe studies 3 or 4 methodologies. thus, the sale intervention\\nwould impede adaptation to the new outcome for asians, as we\\nexplained above. in study 5, however, no future or alternate pros-\\npect whatsoever is specified, so the contrarian tendency of asians\\nis likely to be weaker. therefore in study 5 use of the new pur-\\nchase price as the reference point can eclipse the asians’ usual\\ncontrarian view to some extent, thereby resulting in a slight in-\\ncrease in reference point adaptation. nevertheless, in all studies,\\nthe increase in adaptation is much greater for westerners than\\nfor easterners, suggesting that for americans the dominant factor\\nis the realization of paper gains/losses which helps close the old\\nmental account and shifts the new reference point toward the\\nnew purchase price.\\n\\nwe suggest that reference point adaptation is influenced by\\nmany external and internal factors. its cross-cultural variations\\nencompass a broad set of causes and consequences. despite the\\nseveral new findings presented in this manuscript, our knowl\\nof cross-cultural patterns in the static and dynamic properties of\\nprospect theory or other reference-dependent preferences re-\\nmains quite limited. therefore this domain seems ripe for future\\nresearch. in particular, it may be helpful to study reference point\\nupdating and its effects using field data such as investor trading\\nrecords, aggregate market prices, and analysts’ forecasts of\\nearnings.\\n'"

prominent descriptive theories of decision making under uncertainty. although originally designed as static model it has been widely applied to dynamic settings in economics and business research to understand work effort brand choices capital budgeting stock returns trading volumes and option exercises. an important premise of these applications of prospect theory is that reference points shift over time but only recently have scholars started to explore systematically the dynamic properties of reference points. furthermore research that examines such properties across different cultures is almost non-existent. given the large body of research showing that culture affects individual judgment and decisions primary purpose of this manuscript was to ascertain whether reference point adaptation exhibits cross-cultural variations and if so what are the possible causes of these variations. ll rights reserved. uthor contributed fully and ychology ohio state univernited states. fax natural hypothesis for the dynamics of reference point adaptation is that the reference point moves in manner consistent with the prior outcome shifting upward following gain and downward following loss. using subjects from the us arkes hirshleifer jiang and lim found that reference points adapt asymmetrically such adaptation was significantly larger following gain than following loss. they also found that when the initial paper gain or loss is realized adaptation both to losses and gains appeared to be enhanced. the current paper applied the measurement approach of arkes to encompass both east-asian and us subjects. in addition we employed two additional questionnaire designs to estimate reference points. in all approaches we identified both cross-cultural similarities and differences in reference point adaptation. performing cross-cultural studies in reference point adaptation was motivated by recent research that has documented important differences in several judgment and decision making phenomena across countries. east-asians who live in collectivist societies exhibit behavioral differences in many aspects from americans who live in an individualist society. research has shown that relative to americans east-asians appear to be more overconfident more risk seeking in the financial domain more holistic than analytic more likely to in somewhat similar spirit strahilevitz and loewenstein conjectured that... adaptation to losses takes longer than adaptation to gains and would therefore require greater time interval to observe.  mailto fig..  no adaptation to the loss that is depicted at point.  full adaptation to the loss that is depicted at point.. arkes organizational behavior and human decision processes attribute outcomes to contextual rather than to internal factors more prone to detect stronger associations between events and apt to place less value on having personal control and more likely to expect that changes that have occurred in the past will reverse in the future. all of these factors represent potential influences on the determination of reference points. cross-cultural study of reference point adaptation can help us to understand the potential sources of variations in financial market behavior across the world. scholars have used prospect theory to understand number of anomalous stock market phenomena including excess volatility the equity premium puzzle the value effect the momentum effect the disposition effect and ipo underperformance. there is evidence that the high equity premium the value effect the momentum effect and the disposition effect are present outside the united states to varying extents. the issue of reference point updating is potentially important for applications of prospect theory to these empirical findings. motivation and literature review reference point adaptation in prospect theory kahneman and tversky proposed prospect theory as an alternative to the normative theory of expected utility maximization. there are three main elements of prospect theory first people derive utility from gains and losses relative to reference point while traditional utility theory assumes that people derive utility from total wealth or consumption. although the reference point is generally one current wealth aspiration levels or norms can also serve this function. second the value function is concave in the domain of gains and convex in the domain of losses. the shape of the function captures dual risk attitudes individuals tend to be risk averse in thin domain but risk seeking in the loss domain. third the effect of loss on utility is much larger than that of gain of the same size. prospect theory has most commonly been applied to static decision environments. in dynamic applications such as stock trading fama and french rouwenhorst grinblatt and keloharju chui titman and wei fand seasholes and dimson marsh staunton. repeated bargaining and negotiation work efforts and firm investments it is important to understand how reference points are updated after individuals experience outcomes over time. consider the prospect theory value function depicted in fig.. if loss has occurred the decision maker is at point in fig.. if subsequent decision is to be made and the reference point has not adapted to the initial loss the decision maker will likely be risk seeking in that further loss will cause only small decrease on the y-axis whereas further gain will result in larger increase. however if the decision maker adapts fully to the initial loss then fig. depicts this situation. now the decision maker will be less risk seeking because the re-centering of the origin of thaph on the current state of affairs causes loss to be more painful than it would have been in fig.. thus if the reference point does not budge following loss then the decision maker is likely to become risk seeking and to try to recover the loss leading to such phenomena as the sunk cost effect or the disposition effect. on the other hand if the reference point adapts downward following loss the decision maker is able to make peace with this loss and will be less likely to throw good money after bad.  there are very few cross-cultural studies pertaining to the static aspects of prospect theory. however we know of no cross-cultural research on its dynamic aspects which are the focus of our study. there are very few studies testing the dynamic aspects of prospect theory using us subjects. using both hypothetical outcomes depicted in questionnaire studies and monetary outcomes from coin-toss game chen and rao found that the order in which two equal but opposite events occurred affected the subject final affective state suggesting that shift in the reference point must have occurred after the first event. they also found that adding time lapse between the two events generated results consistent with greater shift in reference points. however their method does not allow estimates of the location of new reference points. gneezy endowed subjects with stock and then queried them about their willingness to hold or sell it as its price varied over several trading periods. gneezy assumed that subjects are most willing to sell when the current price is equal to the reference point and showed that assuming stock peak price to be the reference point best explained subjects willingness to sell that stock. gneezy method can position the reference point relative to prior stock prices only when the subject sells the stock. baucells weber and welfens estimated the reference point by asking subjects which selling price would make them neither happy nor unhappy after they observed stock price path. by regressing the reference point indicated by the subject on the purchase price the current price and the intermediate prices baucells showed that the reference point is most heavily influenced by the first and the last observed stock price. all of these studies suggest that reference points are pathdependent past prices in addition to the purchase price appear to have significant impacts on the current reference point. this implies that reference points adapt to outcome payoffs. however these studies do not estimate the exact magnitude of reference point adaptation after gain or loss. they therefore do not allow comparative analyses such as the test of gain-loss asymmetry. arkes estimated the changes in reference point location following stock trading gains and losses using both questionnaires and real money incentives. they found that the reference point adapts to prior gains to greater extent than to prior losses using two main procedures which we adopted and will explain in detail in the current studies and. also when subjects were forced to sell stock and then repurchase it at the same price at which it had been sold arkes found that reference point adaptation was accelerated reference points moved closer towards the new purchase price.. arkes organizational behavior and human decision processes cross-cultural differences in decision making weber and hsee and hsee and weber showed that chinese are less risk averse than americans in their financial decisions but not in other domains such as medical and academic decisions. weber and hsee found that under general riskreturn framework the perception of the riskiness of financial investment options is lower among chinese than americans and argue that this difference in risk perception can explain cross-cultural differences in risk preferences. hsee and weber suggest that chinese are less risk averse because financial cushion that is available in collectivist culture makes chinese less afraid of risk. consistent with this hypothesis they found that the cross-cultural differences between the chinese and americans in perceived financial risks became insignificant once they controlled for social network variables such as the number of people an individual could rely on for financial assistance. ji documented greater expectation of reversals by asians than americans. in five studies ji showed that chinese students were more likely to predict change from an initial trend than were americans. in the research mostly closely related to our studies ji zhang and guo presented north american and chinese subjects both college students and experienced investors with graphs illustrating upward downward or stable price trends of various stocks. compared to the north american subjects the chinese participants were more likely to buy stocks whose prices were decreasing and sell stocks whose prices were increasing. protocol analyses indicated that this contrarian tendency on the part of the chinese was due to their belief that change was likely in the future. thus compared to americans chinese subjects or asian subjects in general might be more likely to predict that gains would be followed by losses and conversely. any such difference would have important implications for the valuation and willingness to continue holding stock following an initial price movement. in this paper we employed the experimental designs used in arkes and two additional methods to infer reference points. we have four goals in mind. first we measured reference point adaptation among east-asians to ascertain if theater adaptation to gains than losses was present across cultures as was documented among us participants in arkes. second we examined if there is cross-cultural difference in the magnitude of reference point adaptation between east-asians and americans. third we ascertained whether the intervention of the sale and repurchase of stocks accelerated reference point adaptation in the asian culture as was previously demonstrated in the american sample. finally we explored the possible explanations for the observed cross-cultural variation in reference point adaptation.  the exchange rate between the us dollar and korea won is close to the ratio of the purchasing powers of two currencies. however there is discrepancy between the exchange rate and the purchasing power ratio for the us dollars and china. for instance an equivalent mcdonald meal or an hour of math tutoring costs roughly times more in the us than in china. therefore for the chinese subjects we made an adjustment to their prize based on the relative price of mcdonald meal or payment for tutoring services in the two markets. this strategy ensured similar incentives from the perspective of an average subject across all countries. study questionnaire study of reference point adaptation following arkes in this questionnaire study we asked subjects to indicate stock price today that would generate the same utility as previous stock price change. assume that the first stock price resulted in level of utility which is function of the difference between the first stock price and the reference point. subjects indicate the price of the stock today that would generate the same utility as the previous price. assuming constant shape of the prospect value function we have. thus the distance between the indicated stock price and the new reference point must be equal to the distance between the prior stock price and the old reference point r. so the reference point adaptation r. that is reference point adaptation can be inferred from the subject indication of the stock price today that would generate the same utility as the previous price change. there were three main results in our studies. first the asymmetric adaptation found in american students by arkes was also found in the asian participants as well as our table mean reference point adaptation base and intervention. gain loss gain loss asia....  us....  total.... note each subject answered either the base case scenarios or the intervention scenarios. new us subjects. thus this result appears to generalize across cultures. the asymmetric adaptation to gains and losses according to arkes can be caused by fundamental hedonic processes. specifically faster adaptation to gains than to losses results from hedonic benefits of segregating intertemporal gains and integrating intertemporal losses. after gain updating the reference point modestly upward to capture part of thin generates an immediate hedonic benefit from recognizing thin at the cost of reducing any remaining gains to be experienced. however the increase in the immediate gain from is in the steep portion of the value function whereas the reduction in futurins is from gently sloping part of the value function. so due to the concavity of the value function within the region of gains this is net utility increase. for losses similarly recognizing part of loss immediately has an immediate hedonic cost and by the convexity of the value function in the realm of losses this cost outws the benefit of reducing future losses. so no updating is preferred to updating after losses. while the hedonic maximization suggests partial adaptation after gain and no adaptation after loss the sense of reality is likely to encourage adaptation toward the current state in both directions. therefore we are likely to see some extent of adaptation in both directions with greater adaptation after gain than after loss. thal of such affective neering is hedonic maximization. we hypothesize that culture would have minimal role to play in the pursuit of this goal. thus we expect to observe asymmetric adaptation to gains and losses in all countries. the second main finding was that without the sales and repurchase intervention adaptation to prior outcomes was greater among asians than among americans. this result may be caused by different impacts of culture on balancing the two forces determining the new reference point recognizing the current state and deviating from it in order to maximize hedonic utility. we conjecture that there are two culture-related reasons that influence this balance. first faster adaptation among asians can be attributed to the smaller loss aversion among asians that encourages greater adaptation to increase hedonic utility. based on the model of reference point updating explained above smaller loss aversion facilitates adaptation to loss since segregation of prior loss is now less painful. it also encourages adaptation to gain since it reduces the negative impact of possible subsequent loss updating of the reference point means that subsequent loss will occur in the flatter portion of thin function rather than in the relatively steep portion close to the origin of thaph where person would be if no updating had occurred. second cross-cultural research has shown that in many respects east-asians hold fundamentally different viewpoint than americans viewpoint which might encourage asians to move the new reference point closer to the current stock price than americans would do. east-asians view the world as complex and highly changeable with interrelated components where individuals are less able to impact the course of an event. in contrast americans view the world consisting of discrete independent and stable objects where each individual is in control of their own behavior and the consequence of such behavior. such viewpoints lead to asians more malleable and americans more stable preferences and personalities we found no significant relationship between the magnitude asymmetry of reference point adaptation and measure of cognitive ability. therefore difference in cognitive ability is unlikely to be responsible for the cultural differences we report here. arkes organizational behavior and human decision processes choi nisbett. as hsu noted the chinese tends to mobilize his thought and action for the purpose of conforming to the reality while the american tends to do so for the purpose of making the reality conform to him.  these cultural differences suggest that in the tradeoff between conforming to reality and hedonic maximization that involves personal control asians are likely to be dictated by the former while americans by the latter. thus reference points tend to adapt more readily among asians than among americans. as for the third finding the insertion of the stock sale intervention facilitated adaptation in the us significantly more than that in the two asian countries. this cross-cultural difference is reflected in chinese proverb good fortune may forebode bad luck which may in turn disguise good fortune that describes the belief of chinese in reversals. this effect is particularly strong in studies and where asians reference point adaptation is decreased when the intervention is introduced while that of americans is increased. in study however the intervention slightly increased the adaptation of asians while increasing adaptation of americans to greater extent. in other words although the intervention caused greater adaptation in the americans again replicating arkes it had much milder sometimes an opposite effect among asians. we hypothesize that two factors are responsible for this result. the first factor is the one that motivated the use of this intervention. arkes hypothesized that by having the subject sell the stock and realize the paper gain loss the new price at which their gain or loss occurs becomes more salient. this encourages adaptation from the original price toward that new price at which the sale and new purchase occurs. indeed that is what happened in the american sample in arkes and consistently occurs to our american sample in this manuscript. the second factor is discussed by ji and ji nisbett. ji showed that compared to americans asians thought that there were stronger associations between objects consistent with the notion that east-asians pay more attention to the field and the interaction between objects. in contrast americans viewed objects as more independent identities. in our experimental setting the two outcomes one being the prior outcome payoff and the other being the new gain or loss may be viewed by americans as relatively independent. thus the outcome payoff in the old mental account becomes distant and less relevant once the new mental account is established with the new purchase price serving as salient cue for the new reference point. in contrast while east-asians may also close the old and open the new mental account to some extent they are likely to feel the tug of the prior reference point more than the americans would and not dismiss it as an independent and irrelevant separate entity. depending how scenario is framed and presented strong contrarian view in prediction among asians can be triggered. ji demonstrated in very wide variety of assessment tasks that chinese persons to significantly greater extent than americans anticipated that circumstances would change. for example chinese subjects more than americans expected chess champion to lose the next match bickering children to eventually become lovers and dating couples to break up. ji showed that this contrarian tendency also applied strongly to chinese participants beliefs about future stock prices. such belief would foster exactly the results we obtained namely less adaptation to the new price when it is emphasized via sale and new purchase manipulation. this is due to the fact that in our experimental setting the sale intervention makes that outcome more salient and thus more strongly triggers the contrarian prediction of asians. if the first price change is positive asian participants will have somewhat greater expectation of an adverse outcome. therefore they will be unwilling to adapt their reference point upward substantially by adapting sluggishly they add cushion to their mental account against theater possibility of future loss. in the case with prior loss asians will expect greater likelihood of futurin. by adapting less aggressively to the prior loss asians will anticipate this futurin and use part of it to offset part of the prior loss. thus we expect asian subjects to adapt less to either prior outcome than americans after sale and new purchase intervention due to the contrarian tendency demonstrated by ji. within the stock trading experiment in study subjects were informed of possible up and down states of future prices. in scenario ii of study subjects were presented in thin frame for example with no change in the price from the first to the second period and then gain to for the third period. subjects also read scenario in which there was gain from to from the first to the second period. they were then asked what price during the third period of scenario would make then just as happy as the third period price of in scenario ii. to answer this question subjects would have to consider the possibility of reversal that is lowering of the third period price in scenario. by presenting cues of possible future price reversal we hypothesize that the contrarian predilection of asians is likely to be strhened under either the studies or methodologies. thus the sale intervention would impede adaptation to the new outcome for asians as we explained above. in study however no future or alternate prospect whatsoever is specified so the contrarian tendency of asians is likely to be weaker. therefore in study use of the new purchase price as the reference point can eclipse the asians usual contrarian view to some extent thereby resulting in slight increase in reference point adaptation. nevertheless in all studies the increase in adaptation is much greater for westerners than for easterners suggesting that for americans the dominant factor is the realization of paper gains losses which helps close the old mental account and shifts the new reference point toward the new purchase price. we suggest that reference point adaptation is influenced by many external and internal factors. its cross-cultural variations encompass broad set of causes and consequences. despite the several new findings presented in this manuscript our knowl of cross-cultural patterns in the static and dynamic properties of prospect theory or other reference-dependent preferences remains quite limited. therefore this domain seems ripe for future research. in particular it may be helpful to study reference point updating and its effects using field data such as investor trading records aggregate market prices and analysts forecasts of earnings. \n",
