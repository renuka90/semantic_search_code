fhorwitz@gsb.uct.ac.za\\n\\nthe term `knowledge worker’ was coined by drucker (1989) to describe individualswho carry knowledge as a powerful resource which they, rather than theorganisation, own. knowledge work can be said to be of an intellectual nature and\\nwhere well quali® ed employees form a signi® cant part of the workforce (alvesson, 2000).\\n\\nthere is, nonetheless, an acknowledged ambiguity in attempting to conclusively de® ne\\n\\nthe notion of a knowledge worker and knowledge intensive ® rms (kifs) (alvesson, 1993).\\n\\nulrich (1998) posits that, with knowledge work increasing, intellectual capital is a ® rm’s\\n\\nonly appreciable asset. vogt (1995) de® nes a knowledge worker as a person with the\\n\\nmotivation and capacity to co-create new insights and the capability to communicate,\\n\\ncoach and facilitate the implementation of new ideas. the work is non-repetitive and\\n\\nresults-oriented, using both t̀raditional’ scienti® c methods and the need for continuous\\n\\nlearning, intuition, new mindsets and imagination. but some of these concepts may be\\n\\ncontradictory and somewhat idealised, according to alvesson (1993: 1000-1004). he notes\\n\\nthat the work of knowledge workers is more aptly characterised as àmbiguity intensive’\\n\\nthan `knowledge intensive’. these workers may have both a traditional knowledge type\\n\\nlinking science and rational analytical problem solving and requisite knowledge, as well\\n\\nas a particular subjectivity requiring an ability to deal with complexity and uncertainty.\\n\\nthe latter requires intuition, creativity, ¯ exibility and social skills. \\n\\nthere is an emerging literature and research evidence on specific hr strategies,\\n\\npractices and organisational blueprints for attracting, motivating and retaining these\\n\\n\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\nworkers (baron and hannan, 2002, hewitt & associates, 2001). alvesson and karreman\\n\\n(2001), drawing from a review of the literature and case studies, argue that k̀nowledge\\n\\nmanagement is as likely, or more so, to operate as a practice for managing people or\\n\\ninformation than as a practice attuned towards facilitating knowledge creation’ (2001: 1).\\n\\nthe knowledge worker has individual and personal knowledge, and organisations are\\n\\nincreasingly seeking ways of transforming this into shared social knowledge deployed\\n\\nfor organisational goals.\\n\\nour research investigates effective hr strategies and practices for attracting,\\n\\nmotivating and retaining knowledge workers. our work considers multinational and\\n\\nlocal knowledge-intensive ® rms (kifs) in six sectors and has two key aims:\\n\\nto determine the best or the most effective hr practices for managing knowledge\\n\\nworkers, for proposing a schema for attracting, motivating and retaining these\\n\\nworkers; and\\n\\nto explore the notion whether there is a distinctive set of hr practices for managing\\n\\nknowledge workers and other workers in general.\\n\\nsecondary aims are: \\n\\n to provide a generic de® nition of knowledge-based ® rms acceptable to most respondents; \\n\\n to compare the acceptable and unacceptable turnover of knowledge workers in relation\\n\\nto other employees and the suite of hr practices used;\\n\\n to identify the reasons and the initiatives taken to address the high levels of knowledge\\n\\nworker turnover; and \\n\\n to identify the forms of employment in which knowledge workers are engaged. these\\n\\ninclude employment as core full-time employees, and as non-core employees with\\n\\nsubcontracting, outsourcing, consulting, part-time, ® xed-term, temporary, casual or\\n\\nhome employment terms.  \\n\\nour conclusions consider the relevance of the ® ndings beyond the east asian context\\n\\nin terms of further directions for cross-cultural comparative research. given the\\n\\nexploratory nature of the above aims, the empirical approach is an investigative one\\n\\nrather than hypothesis testing.  \\n\\nliterature review\\n\\nthe literature on best practices for managing knowledge workers can be grouped into\\n\\nthree related types: \\n\\nattributes and expectations of knowledge workers themselves (hewitt & associates,\\n\\n2001; kinnear and sutherland, 2000);\\n\\norganisation theory and design and literature on the knowledge organisation as a new\\n\\norganisational form (alvesson, 2000, baron et al, 2001; drucker, 1989; handy, 1989), and \\n\\ndistinctive hr and organisational practices for managing knowledge workers and their\\n\\ncareers (baron and hannan, 2002; davenport, 1999; thompson and heron, 2002;\\n\\nulrich, 1998).\\n\\nattributes and work expectations\\n\\nattributes and perceptions of knowledge workers themselves are important determinants of\\n\\ntheir organisational commitment and the best hr practices to attract and retain them\\n\\n(kinnear and sutherland, 2000). this group of workers possess particular skills that are in\\n\\nhigh demand. they are autonomous people who enjoy occupational advancement and\\n\\nmobility and resist a traditional command and control culture, with their commitment more\\n\\noccupationally than organisationally oriented. since they often work in teams dealing with\\n\\nproblems and issues as opposed to tasks, they are more critical to the long-term success of an\\n\\n24 human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\norganisation in this information-based age as much of an organisation’s core competencies\\n\\nreside in them. new hr systems and skills are therefore required to employ them. \\n\\nin common with findings in the us and in european and african countries,\\n\\nknowledge worker turnover in singapore has been higher than other employee groups\\n\\n(despres and hiltrop, 1995; dessler, 2000; singapore government statistics, 2001).\\n\\nmeeting hr needs with the necessary talent when there is an unacceptably high exodus\\n\\nof knowledge workers is proving increasingly more dif® cult and costly ±  up to 2.5 times\\n\\nthe annual salary due to re-employment costs (cascio, 2001). even in a global economic\\n\\ndownturn characterised by downsizing and layoffs, organisations still need to retain key\\n\\nknowledge workers. failure may undermine the competitive capability, intellectual\\n\\ncapital, cultural fabric and institutional memory of such ® rms. following alvesson and\\n\\nkarreman (2001: 905-1014), who note that `knowledge management is an odd couple’, a\\n\\nknowledge management perspective is useful in managing the human capital of\\n\\norganisations or indeed vice versa (table 1). \\n\\nalthough a kif may need fewer people, those recruited must possess distinctive\\n\\nknowledge to add particular economic value to the organisation (jack, 1993). as knowledge\\n\\nbecomes redundant in the rapidly changing environment, ¯ exible employment relationship\\n\\npatterns become a feature in organisations, and the changing psychological contract\\n\\nin¯ uences hr practices such as work design and workplace relationship models (baron and\\n\\nhannan, 2002; alvesson, 2000; thompson and heron, 2002). factors such as changing\\n\\nworkforce demographics, as exempli® ed by an aging population made obsolete by it in\\n\\neurope, japan and other developed countries, have important effects on the nature of work\\n\\nand on hr planning. these hr practices (1) pose attraction and retention challenges for the\\n\\nyounger, more mobile people capital, (2) cause a productivity decline if there is (a) a failure\\n\\nto transfer valued knowledge from one generation to another; or (b) a failure to create an\\n\\ninnovative organisational culture as the age, gender and cultural diversity of organisations\\n\\nchanges; and (3) result in lower competitiveness if such organisations are unable to retain\\n\\ntheir knowledge workers (alvesson, 2000; watson wyatt, 2001). \\n\\nlabour statistics from south-east asia illustrate the challenges in managing\\n\\nknowledge workers, particularly the it professionals, as organisations seek to capitalise\\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n25human resource management

1997 (itma and imarc\\n\\nsurvey, 1997), while in singapore it reached 18.9 per cent in 1999 and 17.5  per cent in\\n\\n2000 (itma and imarc survey, 2001). even during the asian economic crisis in the late\\n\\n1990s, the voluntary turnover of all categories of knowledge workers rose above 17 per\\n\\ncent, until recent global economic downturn curtailed this. comparatively, the average\\n\\nworkforce resignation rates for all other categories of workers in singapore between 1990-\\n\\n2000 were much lower: about 1.7 per cent and 6.9 per cent in 1990 and 2000 respectively\\n\\n(singapore government statistics, 2001). \\n\\na study of chief executives in 355 companies in 10 east asian countries identi® ed\\n\\nthree key differentiated attributes of ̀ best

exibly balancing workplace demands with the need for work/life balance. \\n\\nalthough the above study did not focus exclusively on knowledge organisations or\\n\\nknowledge workers, their differentiators are relatively consistent with studies which did.\\n\\na study on job satisfaction of knowledge workers identi® ed pay, the nature of work and\\n\\nemployability prospects as the most important job satisfaction variables (economic\\n\\nintelligence unit and andersen consulting/accenture, 2001). other contributing factors\\n\\nwere decision making and peer relationships. these factors are consistent with the\\n\\n® ndings by kinnear and sutherland (2000). alvesson (2000) and thompson and heron\\n\\n(2002). alvesson (2000: 1112-1113) refers to different and changing bases for organisational\\n\\nidenti® cation and loyalty. he distinguishes between institutional and communitarian\\n\\nloyalty, the former referring to the culture, norms and stories, organisational symbols and\\n\\npractices which create institutional loyalty of individuals. in the context of a changing\\n\\npsychological contract (thompson and heron, 2002), communitarian-based loyalty refers\\n\\nto identi® cation with a group relying strongly on interpersonal relations and perceived\\n\\ncommon interests. the former loyalty type may arguably be more instrumental to\\n\\norganisational needs. the combination of these measures of control are referred to as\\n\\nsocial-integrative management (alvesson, 2000). both are important in motivation and\\n\\nretention of knowledge workers, although they themselves may more strongly identify\\n\\nwith occupationally based peer relations of a communitarian loyalty type.\\n\\nkif organisation theory and design \\n\\nthe notion of a kif can be viewed in terms of emergent knowledge-based theory as an\\n\\ninstitution for integrating the specialist knowledge of its members (grant, 1996; thompson\\n\\nand heron, 2002). a central challenge for these ® rms is their ability to manage employees\\n\\ncritical to knowledge creation by ensuring that hr strategies enable the creation and\\n\\nappropriation of knowledge (thompson and heron, 2002: 1). strategic choices of core\\n\\ncompetencies needed to enhance differentiating competitive capabilities may be an\\n\\nimportant feature of knowledge organisations. a knowledge organisation may have\\n\\ndifferent design forms, with flatter, networked structures which may be diffuse and\\n\\nboundaryless or loosely coupled organisational environments with decentralised and often\\n\\nnetworked decision-making in a disaggregated or co-ordinated sub-units. these may be in\\n\\nthe form of joint ventures or strategic alliances (drucker, 1989; handy, 1989; thompson and\\n\\nheron, 2002). these structural types alter normative forms of control through cultures and\\n\\nidentities which replace more direct command and control mechanisms (alvesson, 2000).\\n\\nrelating to these changing organisation forms, hertzenberg et al (2000) and stamps (1996)\\n\\nargue that a knowledge organisation requires high-level skills, such as abstract reasoning\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\n26 human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\nand high cognition. this means having people with the ability to observe, synthesise and\\n\\ncommunicate new perspectives and insights, leading to more effective decisions, solutions\\n\\nand processes (kinnear and sutherland, 2000; robertson and o’malley hammersley, 2000).\\n\\nhowever, as argued by alvesson (1993: 1014), ̀ kifs may be a useful category with which to\\n\\noperate if one considers the claims to knowledge, rather than knowledge itself, the\\n\\nambiguity and rhetoric of knowledge-intensive ® rms, organisations and workers’. in this\\n\\nregard the ability to apply and advance knowledge is tempered with work content which\\n\\nrequires coping with ambiguity, as previously discussed. this organisational form may\\n\\nrequire work to be done relatively independently, with ¯ exible work arrangements. it needs\\n\\noccupationally specialised workers, who may be rather itinerant or nomadic (hertzenberg\\n\\net al, 2000) and requires a shared information/knowledge culture (vogt, 1995). it also\\n\\nrequires adaptable employees with high technological literacy who are continuous learners\\n\\n(dessler, 2000; stamps, 1996). knowledge creation and diffusion become essential core\\n\\ncompetencies, although knowledge workers may have stronger occupational than\\n\\norganisational identification (robertson and o’malley hammersley, 2000) and\\n\\ncommunitarian-based loyalties (alvesson, 2000). a mix of knowledge-intensive and\\n\\nsubjective-intuitive rhetoric becomes salient in de® ning knowledge workers and the nature\\n\\nof their work, noting, though, the ambiguity in attempting to provide a conclusive and\\n\\nembracing de® nition of a complex phenomenon such as knowledge work (alvesson, 1993).\\n\\nnormatively, organisation culture, structure, hr systems and practices would\\n\\neffectively interact to attract, retain and motivate knowledge workers. this would\\n\\nfacilitate autonomous, self-directed work, depending on the levels of controls and\\n\\naccountability, and ¯ exibility in working conditions (working hours, ¯ exi-time, part-time\\n\\nwork and home working). barrett et al (2000) and becker et al (2001) differentiate between\\n\\ntangible and intangible organisational processes and practices in kifs. intangibles refer\\n\\nto work practices such as building trust and relationships, and learning diffusion in work\\n\\nprocess improvements and innovation. these would turn tacit knowledge within\\n\\nemployees to explicit knowledge, which is important in building both intellectual and\\n\\nsocial capital, accessible by others in the organisation. firms such as dell and\\n\\namazon.com have invented new business models based largely on these knowledge\\n\\nassets. these tenets underline the importance of work culture reinforced by aligned hr\\n\\nsystems and practices for the successful employment of knowledge workers (hewitt and\\n\\nassociates, 2001; robertson and o’malley hammersley, 2000; ulrich, 1998). the literature\\n\\nhighlights the need to further identify contextually appropriate and effective hr\\n\\npractices for attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers.\\n\\nhr practices for managing knowledge workers\\n\\nbaron and hannan (2002) provide an instructive conceptual framework with three\\n\\ndimensions of employment blueprints for success in high-tech start-up ® rms. first, a basis\\n\\nof attachment and retention includes compensation, quality of work and work group as a\\n\\ncommunity ±  a notion similar to alvesson’s communitarian-based loyalty and social\\n\\nidentity. this is a key basis for creating the second dimension for attachment ±  criteria for\\n\\nselection ±  which includes skills, exceptional talent/potential and fit with a team or\\n\\norganisation. thirdly, means of control and co-ordination include direct monitoring or peer\\n\\nor cultural control, reliance on professional standards, and formal processes and\\n\\nprocedures. these dimensions were then placed into an organisational typology with the\\n\\nfollowing models: \\n\\n1 the `star’ organisation which recruits top talent, pays very high wages and provides\\n\\nresources and autonomy to perform; \\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n27human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\n2 the commitment-based organisation where people want to work in the long run; \\n\\n3 the bureaucracy where roles and functions are clearly prescribed with rigid project\\n\\nmanagement techniques; \\n\\n4 the engineering model with a `skunk-works’ mentality and with high binding energy; \\n\\n5 the autocracy with a traditional instrumental and contractual basis for work. \\n\\ndifferent models of the ideal organisational form and attendant hr priorities for\\n\\ntechnology start-ups were found. these varied in resilience and sustainability when\\n\\nseeking to incur fundamental changes in both organisation form and hr policy and\\n\\npractice shifts. the most highly represented hr blueprint was the engineering model\\n\\n(30.7 per cent). the high commitment model (13.9 per cent) and star models (9 per cent),\\n\\nmost frequently alluded to in the popular hrm and organisational change literature,\\n\\nwere less prevalent. however, shifting to autocracy and bureaucracy models from the\\n\\nothers was viewed negatively. changes in organisational and hr blueprints tended to\\n\\ncommonly accompany ceo succession. \\n\\nwhile most research has focused on the attributes and work expectations of knowledge\\n\\nworkers, less work has been published on identifying clusters or organisational blueprint\\n\\ntypologies of hr practices which are effective or ineffective in attracting, motivating and\\n\\nretaining these workers. these are often based on continued scarcity of particular skills,\\n\\nspecialised and occupational credentials (hertzenberg et al, 2000). organisational\\n\\nstrategies may therefore include one or more of the following: external talent acquisition;\\n\\ninternal talent development by special assignments; job rotation and action learning;\\n\\nhiring talent from external agents such as consultants and freelance contract workers; and\\n\\ncontractually binding the most desired and talented employees to the organisation (ulrich,\\n\\n1998). however, thompson and heron (2002) posit that traditional employment contracts\\n\\nmay no longer be effective in bonding knowledge workers and retaining loyalty. a new\\n\\npsychological contract requires a different employment relationship, organisational design\\n\\nand hr practices. loyalty still has to be managed in knowledge-intensive companies to\\n\\navoid unwanted exits alvesson (2000: 1119).\\n\\nfactors put forward as important in motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\ninclude challenging work, creating a work culture permitting relative autonomy,\\n\\ncelebrating achievement and developing a sense of purpose, direction and excitement.\\n\\nother practices include willingness to share gains, effective communications, concern for\\n\\npeople by respecting the dignity of the individual, providing enabling resources (such as\\n\\nnew technology) and enabling employees to acquire skills to increase their employability\\n\\nin both internal and external labour markets (robertson and o’malley hammersley, 2000;\\n\\nulrich, 1998). the last practice is gaining prominence through self-development and\\n\\ninvolvement in interdisciplinary and cross-functional projects, in support of the idea of a\\n\\nlearning organisation. this may lead to new psychological contracts, with individuals\\n\\nseeking market sustainable employability and organisations requiring high work\\n\\ncommitment rather than job security and loyalty.\\n\\nthere is increasing evidence that particular organisations are beginning to acknowledge\\n\\nthat distinctive hr practices lead to better knowledge worker performance. thompson and\\n\\nheron (2002) found that the importance of job design as an important dimension of ful® lling\\n\\nthe psychological contract, is associated with higher levels of knowledge creation, affective\\n\\ncommitment and organisational citizenship behaviour. hansen et al (1999) cite that the\\n\\nperformance review of consultants at ernst & young include evaluating their contributions\\n\\nand utilisation of knowledge assets. the consultancy ® rm, bain & co, rewards staff for\\n\\nsharing knowledge and help given to others. research also reveals that there is a\\n\\nrelationship between the type of reward given and performance based on knowledge\\n\\nsharing (hansen et al, 1999; keegan, 1998; roberson and o’malley hammersley, 2000; swan\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\n28 human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\net al, 1999). some researchers have identi® ed standard hr practices that are vital for the\\n\\nretention and the reduction of voluntary turnover of knowledge workers (lee and maurer,\\n\\n1997; kinnear and sutherland, 2000). others, focusing on the key area of compensation, note\\n\\nthat traditional approaches to work remuneration and reward are no longer appropriate in a\\n\\npost-industrial knowledge economy (despres and hiltrop, 1995). most favoured retention\\n\\nstrategies for knowledge workers focused on a portfolio of practices which includes the\\n\\nfreedom to act independently, appropriate job design, certain types of ® nancial rewards\\n\\nbased on recognition of achievements, development opportunities, and access to leading-\\n\\nedge technology (kinnear and sutherland, 2000; thompson and heron, 2002). \\n\\nwe now consider some of these factors in more detail ±  in particular, knowledge\\n\\nworkers’ careers. thurow (2000: 140) says that: `the old career ladders are gone. the old\\n\\nlifetime employees are gone. if career ladders don’t exist within one company, they must\\n\\nexist across different companies if they are to exist at all. kalra (1997) argues that hr\\n\\npolicies and practices designed for career development need to shift from conventional\\n\\ntraining and development to an integrative, continuous process of capability development,\\n\\nwith the responsibility shifting increasingly to the individual (beck, 2000). butler and\\n\\nwaldrop (2001) argue that, while traditional career paths may be based primarily on a\\n\\n® rm’s interests, there is now a shift to sculpting jobs based on the deeply embedded life\\n\\ninterests of knowledge worker professionals. an individual will need to retool and\\n\\ndevelop a portfolio of careers over time to remain employable. despres and hiltrop (1995)\\n\\ncharacterise knowledge workers as having careers external to an organisation through\\n\\nyears of education, rather than internal training and career schemes. cappelli (2001) and\\n\\nkalra (1997) similarly argue that retention efforts require a shift from broad programmes to\\n\\nhighly targeted initiatives. cappelli cites how prudential insurance customises certain jobs\\n\\nto both categories of employees and individuals. this required rethinking of\\n\\ncompensation, job design, and job customisation and hiring practices. market-driven\\n\\nretention mechanisms may include a `hot skills’ premium; staggered signing bonuses; job\\n\\nredesign to retain speci® c skills; de® ned employment tenure; tailoring jobs to individual\\n\\nneeds; and adaptation to attrition, for example by outsourcing and cross-training. \\n\\nmethodology\\n\\nbased on the literature review and research objectives, a structured questionnaire was\\n\\ndesigned for gathering data, with ® ve major sections. the ® rst covered organisational\\n\\npro® le, including industry sector, ® rm ownership, number of employees and percentage of\\n\\nknowledge workers. the second section had ® ve de® nitions that described knowledge\\n\\nworkers,  requiring two which most aptly describe knowledge workers in their\\n\\norganisations to be chosen. in the third section, the deployment of knowledge workers as\\n\\nfull-time employees or as non-core employees (such as sub-contractor, consultant, part-\\n\\ntime, ® xed-term contract and others) was speci® ed. the fourth and main section listed\\n\\nstrategies for attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers. the last section\\n\\ndealt with voluntary labour turnover, the acceptable and tolerable level of turnover,\\n\\nreasons for turnover and remedial measures taken. the questionnaire was pre-tested with\\n\\n® ve hr managers from kifs to improve the construct validity of the questionnaire. this\\n\\nled to improvements in the de® nitions of knowledge workers, reclassi® cation of categories\\n\\nof knowledge workers and re-phrasing of questions to improve the clarity. \\n\\nconvenience sampling was used. based on definitions from the literature, only\\n\\nknowledge-based ® rms were sampled. while this may limit broad generalisations from\\n\\nour ® ndings, we submit that they do offer fairly clear directions, given the focus on such\\n\\n® rms. lists of such organisations were obtained from industry associations, personal\\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n29human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\nknowledge and contacts. from the knowledge worker job types, respondents were\\n\\nasked to indicate the percentage of employees as knowledge workers. using a three-\\n\\npoint interval-type format, data was obtained on the actual practices used, the\\n\\neffectiveness of these practices in managing knowledge workers and the actual turnover\\n\\nrates of both knowledge and other worker types. each question was framed based on\\n\\nliterature research. for instance, kinnear and sutherland (2000) found that one of the\\n\\nmost favoured retention strategies for knowledge workers was the practice of allowing\\n\\nthem the freedom to act independently, and thompson and heron (2002) refer to the\\n\\nimportance of job design as a component of the psychological contract. questionnaires\\n\\nwere mailed to ceos in 200 organisations based on a list which included companies\\n\\nwith more than 20 workers from six industry classifications described below. the\\n\\nmajority of questionnaires were completed by the ceo and the rest by a director or\\n\\ngroup manager responsible for human resources. there is the possibility of a `halo’ effect\\n\\nin the latter`s responses, although most were quite willing to indicate which hr\\n\\nstrategies had failed.\\n\\neach variable in attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers was\\n\\nsubjected to statistical correlation analysis. these variables were ranked, with the highest\\n\\nrank based on the highest frequency of usage by companies. a model for attracting,\\n\\nmotivating and retaining knowledge workers was developed, based on the data that\\n\\nshowed signi® cant correlations (p < .05 or less). one-way analysis of variance was used\\n\\nfor testing the impact of variables such as ownership, size and nature of business in\\n\\nrelation to the above practices. \\n\\nresults\\n\\nforty-four usable responses (22.0 per cent response rate) were received. they were classi® ed\\n\\ninto six industrial groups: (a) electronics, semi-conductors and wafer fabrication (27.3 per\\n\\ncent); (b) it (20.5 per cent); (c) telecommunications and communications (15.9 per cent); (d)\\n\\nr&d, including biotechnology, life sciences and science and technology (15.9 per cent); (e)\\n\\nventure capital, consulting and ® nancial services (11.4 per cent); and (f) others, including\\n\\ngovernment (9.1 per cent). the largest response rate was from large organisations (39 per\\n\\ncent had more than 200 employees) representing a signi® cant actual number of employees in\\n\\nsingapore. these comprised mncs and large, locally owned corporations, with revenue\\n\\nturnover exceeding s$500 million in over 25 per cent of cases. some 48 per cent of the\\n\\ncompanies were foreign or majority owned, including european mncs such as siemens.\\n\\nabout 57 per cent of ® rms had more than 50 per cent knowledge workers in their total\\n\\nworkforce, with 82 per cent of them in full-time employment. the rest (18 per cent) were\\n\\nnon-core employees, employed as contract, part-time, casual/temporary and home-based\\n\\nworkers.  the largest employers of knowledge workers are from four sectors:\\n\\nelectronics/semi-conductor/wafer fabrication (23.7 per cent of employees), research and\\n\\ndevelopment (19.0 per cent), it (17.5 per cent), and telecommunications/communications\\n\\nsectors (17.0 per cent).\\n\\naccepted de® nitions of knowledge workers\\n\\nfrom the five definitions listed in the survey, the most popular generic definition\\n\\naccepted by more than 78 per cent of respondents is listed below. on the basis of these\\n\\nstatements, organisations responded to questions on strategies employed and labour\\n\\nturnover. the de® nition below is a composite and broad one based on a set of statements\\n\\nabout knowledge work contained in the questionnaire. it is how respondents themselves\\n\\ncategorised knowledge workers in their organisations. it is, in a sense, a set of more than\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\n30 human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\none definition, specific attributes of which may more aptly characterise knowledge\\n\\nworkers in some ® rms than others. following alvesson (2000), however, it contains three\\n\\nkey sense-making and perhaps contrasting attributes: a knowledge worker as working\\n\\nwith both ambiguity-intensive information or knowledge, as well as an extant scienti® c\\n\\nbody of knowledge and being required to share and deploy personal knowledge for\\n\\norganisational purposes ±  a communitarian/social phenomenon. \\n\\nknowledge workers have high level of skills/education, with technological\\n\\nliteracy, high cognitive power and abstract reasoning. this includes the ability\\n\\nto observe, synthesise and interpret data, and to communicate new\\n\\nperspectives and insights to lead to more effective decisions, processes and\\n\\nsolutions for the organisation. the knowledge creation process is part of the\\n\\norganisation’s competitive strategy, characterised by information/\\n\\nknowledge sharing and team collaboration to produce more effective actions\\n\\nand solutions. \\n\\nattraction strategies \\n\\nto attract knowledge workers, the most popularly used strategies were related to\\n\\nrecruitment strategies (targeted media advertising, use of headhunters and online\\n\\nrecruitment) and opportunities for career and talent development (table 2). \\n\\nhighly effective attraction strategies require a bundle of practices (table 3), of which a\\n\\nhighly competitive pay package was the top strategy used. others included proactive\\n\\nrecruitment and selection initiatives and funded internal staff development. \\n\\nalthough fairly widely used, some practices such as online recruitment, general\\n\\nadvertising and the use of headhunters were ineffective attraction strategies, particularly\\n\\nin attracting more experienced people (table 4). \\n\\nalthough online recruitment was used in 23 out of 44 ® rms, it was considered an\\n\\nineffective practice. a possible explanation for this is that potential job applicants may\\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed

cent).\\n\\ntable 4 least effective strategies*\\n\\n\\n\\nmotivation strategies \\n\\nas tables 2 and 3 show, the most popular and highly effective strategies out of 23 types for\\n\\nmotivating knowledge workers included practices which allowed a knowledge worker\\n\\nfreedom to plan work (67 per cent of industries). this is consistent with previous research\\n\\n(baron and hannan, 2002; thompson and heron, 2002). as this research focused on\\n\\nemployer strategies and perceptions of effectiveness rather than on knowledge workers’\\n\\nviews on what motivates them, there may be a potential bias in the response. however, the\\n\\nresponse was consistent with studies which surveyed knowledge workers themselves (eg\\n\\nbaron and hannan, 2002; kinnear and sutherland, 2000; thompson and heron, 2002). \\n\\na challenging work environment and support of top management were both popular\\n\\nand highly effective for motivation. while having regular contacts with the senior\\n\\nexecutives was popular, having access to leading-edge technology was more effective to\\n\\nmotivate the knowledge workers. this was found to be more so in particular sectors such\\n\\nas it, but was not necessarily universal across all industries. where technology and its\\n\\napplications were themselves the core nature of the work output, this might be more\\n\\nlikely. there were, on the other hand, some interesting contradictions. while the use of\\n\\nincentive bonuses was also popular, it was not considered a highly effective motivation\\n\\nstrategy. this could be explained by an already high level of compensation paid and that\\n\\nadditional compensation per se was viewed as less important than intrinsic work design\\n\\nand attendant job satisfaction. the former has been found to be positively associated with\\n\\naffective commitment and the propensity for knowledge creation (thompson and heron,\\n\\n2002: 13-14). it seems that many firms are only beginning to discover that financial\\n\\nincentives are not a panacea for motivational problems, although the persistence with\\n\\nthese forms of pay is surprising. it may be that either the design and/or implementation\\n\\nmay be ¯ awed and ® rms are willing to modify these schemes to try and get them to work.\\n\\ntable 4 shows some of the least effective strategies used to motivate knowledge workers.\\n\\nhaving a critical mass of knowledge workers does not guarantee high motivation, neither\\n\\ndo certain types of ¯ exible work practices such as ¯ exi-time. the former ® nding may\\n\\ncontradict the communitarian-based notion of collegiality and knowledge-sharing\\n\\n(alvesson 2000). knowledge workers may be required, and controls and incentives may be\\n\\nexerted, to enable sharing to occur, although the individual knowledge worker may not\\n\\nnecessarily view it in his/her interest to do so, or may simply be disinclined to do so,\\n\\npreferring to work independently. this may create a cognitive dissonance for the individual\\n\\nin terms of dimensions of loyalty to the ® rm, peer group or profession. preferred peer group\\n\\nloyalty does not seem axiomatic from our ® ndings, although there may be a bias in the\\n\\nrespondents being employers. contrary to other authors, frost (2002) argues in this regard\\n\\nthat knowledge workers place greater priority on individual than group goals. as a result,\\n\\nmanagers in kifs must assess and respond to each individual’s needs and provide them\\n\\nwith clear opportunities for personal and professional growth. \\n\\ncash or spot awards and use of scholarships or bursaries are not that effective in\\n\\nmotivating the workers. seeking recruits who ® t an organisational culture may be more\\n\\nappropriate for attraction strategies, but on its own does not appear to be an effective\\n\\nmotivator. the cluster of ineffective practices may be potential `dissatis® ers’ if not in\\n\\nplace, and are not intrinsically motivational (herzberg, 1966). the notion of cultural ® t is\\n\\nmost evident in high commitment cultures (baron and hannan, 2002) and where a\\n\\nknowledge organisation itself provides institutional myths and symbols (alvesson,\\n\\n2000). knowledge-intensive service organisations may use these myths and symbols to\\n\\ncreate faith, both internally and externally, in the ® rm and its services; management\\n\\nconsultancy and certain types of it service providers are examples. \\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n33human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\nin our research, there was a high level of consistency between other popular, and\\n\\nhighly effective, motivational strategies. these included providing challenging and\\n\\nful® lling work through appropriate job design, and top management support executive\\n\\nsupport. this is supported by recent literature (thompson and heron 2002; baron and\\n\\nhannan, 2002). in terms of motivation strategies which may reduce knowledge worker\\n\\nturnover, it appears that non-® nancial strategies may have had a relationship with lower\\n\\nturnover. these included leadership, ful® lling work and participation in key decisions\\n\\n(while a number of authors cite ® nancial resources as an important motivation factor,\\n\\nmany also consider non-® nancial factors as important (mcdade and mckenzie, 2002;\\n\\nfernandez-aroaz, 2001; florida, 2000).\\n\\nretention strategies \\n\\nthe most popular retention strategies were related to compensation. the others were\\n\\nrelated to work environment ±  having a challenging work environment, freedom to plan\\n\\nwork and encouragement from the top management (table 2). of the most popularly used\\n\\nretention strategies, four out of the ® ve were also found to be highly effective (table 3),\\n\\nproviding challenging work assignments (83 per cent), opportunities to develop in\\n\\nspecialist ® elds (67 per cent) and top management leadership and support (50 per cent).\\n\\nthese findings support the centrality of job design and affective commitment in\\n\\norganisational attachment (thompson and heron, 2002). it seems that both occupational\\n\\nand organisational loyalty may be enhanced as a basis of both organisational attachment\\n\\nand retention by highly competitive pay and intrinsic qualities of the work process (baron\\n\\nand hannan, 2002). these loyalty types may not be as contradictory as is sometimes\\n\\nsuggested, if mediating hr interventions are effective.\\n\\nfactor clusters common to attraction, motivation, and retention\\n\\ntables 3 and 4 show the most and least effective strategies for managing knowledge\\n\\nworkers. as would be expected, there was some overlap (two out of ® ve) of motivational\\n\\nand retention strategies that were considered highly effective. these centred on the\\n\\nnature of the work (having a challenging work assignments or work that was ful® lling,\\n\\nopportunities to develop in a specialist ® eld and access to state-of-the-art technology)\\n\\nand support from top management. a highly  competitive pay package, with\\n\\nperformance incentives, seemed to be more important for attracting and retaining\\n\\nemployees than motivation. this appears consistent with baron and hannan’s (2002)\\n\\nbasis of attachment and retention. this is also explained in terms of the need for cultural\\n\\n® t through selection and recruitment (brelade and harman, 2000). strategies that were\\n\\nleast effective for retention were, similarly, least effective for motivation. the work\\n\\nprocess and job design factors were key in respect of intrinsic motivation and affective\\n\\ncommitment (thompson and heron, 2002). this core dimension also appeared to be\\n\\nassociated with the notion of being attracted to an ’employer of choice’, and would also\\n\\nprovide a basis for social identity, peer collegiality and communitarian loyalty within\\n\\nkifs (alvesson, 2000). the idea of identifying a `bundle’  of hr practices with these\\n\\ncommon attributes has a potentially differentiating ability in a ® rms ability to manage its\\n\\nknowledge workers effectively. \\n\\nknowledge worker turnover\\n\\nmore than 50 per cent of the sample organisations had less than 5 per cent voluntary\\n\\nturnover of knowledge workers whereas another 36 per cent reported to have more than 10\\n\\nper cent. ninety-® ve per cent of those who had less than 5 per cent turnover indicated that\\n\\nthe rate was acceptable to them. however, 75 per cent with turnover higher than 10 per\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\n34 human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\ncent considered this level unacceptable. the turnover of knowledge workers was higher\\n\\nthan other workers. some 71 per cent of employers said that turnover of non-knowledge\\n\\nworkers was less than 10 per cent, compared to 64 per cent of employers with this level of\\n\\nturnover for knowledge workers. this is consistent with the expectation that knowledge\\n\\nworker turnover is higher than non-knowledge workers. \\n\\nthe main reasons knowledge workers resigned were related to pay and job prospects\\n\\n(39 per cent of respondent organisations), personal or undisclosed reasons (20 per cent)\\n\\nand issues related to their career or company (figure 1). this supports baron and\\n\\nhannan (2002). the latter two factors, ie personal and career factors, often relate to\\n\\nchanges in employment models ±  for example, through restructuring ±  and, as baron et al\\n\\n(2001) suggest, these fundamental blueprint changes in organisations often trigger\\n\\nturnover, rather than pay issues alone.\\n\\nfollowing the above analysis, a small percentage (5 per cent) indicates that\\n\\nresignations were directly related to their jobs. individuals appeared to distinguish\\n\\nbetween job specific reasons and longer term career prospects. the latter may be\\n\\nthwarted by changes in employment models or hr blueprints. this was further\\n\\nsupported by market demand factors, career-related issues, personal reasons and aspects\\n\\nof company-related issues. hence the citing of better prospects seemed to echo a need for\\n\\nemployers to provide more than a challenging job ±  a challenging career tailored to\\n\\naligning the needs of the knowledge worker and organisational goals. this is consistent\\n\\nwith butler and waldrop (2001) and thompson and heron (2002). these career-related\\n\\nreasons included seeking new challenges, perceived career stagnation, a need to acquire\\n\\nnew knowledge and joining often larger, more progressive companies. related personal\\n\\nreasons included a need to pursue an alternative career, further studies and a new\\n\\nenvironment. as alvesson (2000: 1119) notes, a crucial part of management in kifs is to\\n\\nmanage loyalty in order to avoid unwanted exits and an egress of core intellectual\\n\\ncapital. loyalty has to stand for something more positive than simply preventing `non-\\n\\nexiting’, particularly if a ® rm seeks to develop an hr brand distinctively differentiating\\n\\nitself from competitors. less effective hr strategies seem limited in (a) their ability to\\n\\naddress the multiple loyalty dimensions posited by alvesson (2000) and (b) the intrinsic\\n\\njob design and associated factors found important by thompson and heron (2002). \\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n35human resource management journal,

further\\n\\nprobing into the data reveals that the sample organisations found competitive pay to be\\n\\nhighly or fairly effective for all three constructs. `funding for studies’  was also\\n\\nsigni® cantly correlated with motivation and retention. organisations found this strategy\\n\\nfairly effective for both these constructs. regarding strategies to motivate, a competitive\\n\\npackage was also signi® cantly correlated with funding for studies. the latter is often part\\n\\nof a competitive package. \\n\\nfurther cross-cultural research could indicate the extent to which competitive pay\\n\\npackages and their composition are comparatively important for all three constructs (ie\\n\\nattraction, motivation and retention), or whether this is only a south-east asian\\n\\nphenomenon. equally, cross-cultural research could explain whether the hrd variable of\\n\\nfirm-funded further education, as a benefit valued highly by knowledge workers in\\n\\ncountries like singapore, is considered as significant and prevalent in europe and\\n\\nelsewhere. in most south-east asian countries, individuals may not be able to study\\n\\nfurther without such assistance.\\n\\norganisational characteristics and hr strategies\\n\\na one-way anova was conducted to test the impact of organisational characteristics (ie\\n\\nownership, nature of business and size) on strategies to attract, motivate and retain. the\\n\\nresults are presented below:\\n\\nownership and hr strategies  signi® cant differences between ownership type (foreign and\\n\\nlocal) and some of the strategies to attract, motivate and retain were found. the effectiveness\\n\\nof using headhunters (f = 3.10, p = .049) and advertising in the general media (f = 3.97, p =\\n\\n.017) to attract was signi® cantly different among different types of ownership (table 6).\\n\\nsimilarly, the effectiveness of overseas assignments (f = 7.38, p = .005) and creating a sense\\n\\nof fun and informality (f = 3.77, p = .034) in order to motivate, as well as involvement in\\n\\ndecision making ( f = 17.57, p = .013) and sense of fun and informality (f = 3.47, p = .048) in\\n\\norder to retain knowledge workers, were signi® cantly different with different types of\\n\\nownership. foreign versus local ownership appears, therefore, to re¯ ect differences in\\n\\ncertain types of hr practices such as using headhunters and advertising media to recruit\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers\\n\\n36 human resource management journal, vol 13 no

explaining\\n\\ndifferences in both the use and effectiveness of particular hr strategies. mncs may rely\\n\\nmore strongly on internal career planning and development, and particularly at senior level\\n\\nmay be less inclined to recruit externally if there are suitable internal job candidates. \\n\\nfurther probing into the data reveals that, to attract knowledge workers, 100 per cent\\n\\nforeign owned ® rms found using headhunters highly effective or fairly effective compared\\n\\nto local ® rms which considered this strategy fairly effective or ineffective. wholly owned\\n\\nforeign and local companies found advertising in the general media to attract knowledge\\n\\nworkers highly or fairly effective as compared with ® rms with less than 50 per cent foreign\\n\\nownership, where this was fairly effective or ineffective. foreign versus local ownership\\n\\nappears, therefore, to re¯ ect differences in certain types of hr practices such as using\\n\\nheadhunters and advertising media to recruit and select knowledge workers. a feature of\\n\\nsingaporean society is a curious mix of confucian formalism, respect for authority and\\n\\nseniority and simultaneous strong adherence to meritocratic values in appointments. this\\n\\nmay result in a greater tendency to look outside the organisation, often outside the nation-\\n\\nstate, in selecting and recruiting key people . \\n\\nfor motivation, overseas assignments were considered highly effective by wholly\\n\\nowned foreign ® rms as opposed to other ownership types. multinational ® rms were most\\n\\nlikely to be able to offer such opportunities. both wholly owned foreign and local ® rms\\n\\nfound creating a sense of fun and informality in order to motivate to be highly or fairly\\n\\neffective as opposed to other types of ownership (eg mixed) where it was less effective. \\n\\nfor retention strategies, both wholly owned foreign and local ® rms found a fun and\\n\\ninformal work environment more highly or fairly effective than mixed owned\\n\\ncompanies. hence, full foreign or local ownership was signi® cantly associated with this\\n\\nfactor. extent of single (wholly owned) versus mixed nationality ownership appears to\\n\\nhave a bearing on the motivational context. this in turn appears to be associated with the\\n\\neffectiveness of particular hr strategies and practices.\\n\\nregarding involvement in decision making, majority-owned (between 50-100 per\\n\\ncent) foreign ® rms found this to be highly effective, as compared with the other two\\n\\ngroups, including 100 per cent local ones, for whom it was only fairly effective. these\\n\\n® ndings support the notion that foreign ® rms tend to be more in favour of involving\\n\\nemployees in the decision making process. (horwitz and smith, 1998).\\n\\norganisation size and hr strategies\\n\\norganisation size was classified using two criteria: total number of employees and\\n\\nannual sales turnover. signi® cant differences were found between sales turnover and the\\n\\ndegree of effectiveness of some strategies to attract, motivate and retain (table 6). they\\n\\nare: bonding for funded recruits (service tie) (f = 4.5, p = .05) to attract, a sense of fun and\\n\\ninformality (f = 4.19, p = .017) for motivation, and challenging work for retention (f =\\n\\n3.50, p = .016). similar analysis with total number of employees showed no signi® cant\\n\\ndifferences between various strategies.\\n\\nfurther analysis revealed that the use of bonding for funded recruits was highly\\n\\neffective for attracting knowledge workers in companies with high sales turnover. these\\n\\nlarger turnover companies were more likely to be able to offer such bene® t. creating a\\n\\nsense of fun and informality in order to motivate was most effective in medium to\\n\\nsmaller companies. creating and legitimating this type of culture may be more dif® cult\\n\\nin larger and more complex organisations, especially where rigid hierarchical and\\n\\nbureaucratic rather than small group or peer controls prevail. financial factors such as\\n\\nsales turnover therefore appear to be better indicators or predictors of choice of a\\n\\nparticular hr strategy than workforce size.\\n\\nfrank m. horwitz, chan teng heng and hesan ahmed quazi\\n\\n37human resource management journal, vol 13 no 4, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\nnature of industry group and hr strategies\\n\\nsigni® cant differences were found between nature of business and certain hr strategies\\n\\n(table 6). degree of effectiveness of an employer of choice or strong employee brand\\n\\nstrategy to attract knowledge workers was significantly different between industry\\n\\ngroups (f = 6.11, p = .013). there were similar differences for ¯ exible work practices and\\n\\nregular performance feedback as motivational practices (f = 5.62, p = .008 and f = 4.10, p\\n\\n= .014 respectively). this suggests that a `one-shoe-® ts-all’ bundle of particular practices\\n\\ncannot be universally applied, supporting a contingency approach. further discussions\\n\\non most effective strategies practiced by the various groups of industries follow.\\n\\nstrategies for attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers were also cross-\\n\\ntabulated across the six industries to determine if there are any industry-speci® c trends.\\n\\nthis is shown in table 7. \\n\\nonly highly effective strategies that gave more than 60 per cent responses were\\n\\nadmissible in order to get a more discriminating industry analysis. findings indicate that\\n\\nnot all the strategies were equally highly effective in each industry. for instance,\\n\\ncompetitive pay appeared to be a highly effective for retention of knowledge workers for\\n\\n® ve industries, but less so for the it industry. there, the reputation of the employer was\\n\\nmore important than a very competitive compensation package. to retain knowledge\\n\\nworkers in this industry, challenging work assignments, preferably with opportunities for\\n\\ncareer development, were key. this could be related to the fact that it workers, having been\\n\\npaid a premium, do not ® nd marginal additional pay as suf® cient enticement for them to\\n\\nstay. motivational factors are related more to work, which must be both ful® lling and\\n\\nallows some independence. this suggests that herzberg’s (1966) two-factor motivation\\n\\ntheory may have a basis in 21st-century knowledge work firms, with the intrinsic\\n\\nmotivating factors being critical in enticing it workers to stay. this is also consistent with\\n\\nthompson and heron (2002) and alvesson’s (2000) notion of multiple forms of loyalty.\\n\\nin the telecommunications industry, a competitive pay package was a common factor\\n\\nin attracting and retaining knowledge workers; other factors, such as challenging and\\n\\nful® lling work, were required to motivate them. for research workers, a host of strategies\\n\\nwere effective in attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers. in the\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting,

characteristics on hr strategies: results of anova\\n\\n\\n\\nelectronics sector, competitive pay appeared to be only strategy that was effective for\\n\\nretaining the workers, while no strategies were effective to attract or motivate them.\\n\\namong consultants, it appeared that, besides a competitive package to attract new hires,\\n\\ntop management support was vital, especially for successful project implementation. \\n\\nin the main, three strategies were effective in motivating knowledge workers in most\\n\\nsectors: freedom to plan and work independently, challenging projects and work, and\\n\\nhaving access to leading edge technology. to retain these workers, a highly competitive\\n\\npay package was essential for most, as well as opportunities to develop in their own\\n\\nspecialist ® eld. these ® ndings are consistent with hackman and oldham’s (1980) job\\n\\ncharacteristics model and thompson and heron’ s (2002) emphasis on job design or\\n\\nredesign in the context of a changing psychological contract and new forms of\\n\\nemployment relationships. \\n\\nimplications for managing knowledge workers\\n\\nour research shows that some of the most popularly used hr strategies are not necessarily\\n\\nthe most effective in attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers. to attract\\n\\nthem, a very competitive pay package is the most effective strategy in kifs in south-east\\n\\nasia for most knowledge worker categories and industries. organisations need to take a\\n\\nmore considered view of what does and does not work. most employers were able to draw\\n\\na clear distinction between a knowledge worker and a non-knowledge worker. it is\\n\\nnecessary, therefore, to differentiate hr practices for managing these two groups. a

ineffective or ineffective.\\n\\ntable 7 highly effective strategies to attract, motivate and retain across industries \\n\\n\\n\\nlimitation of this study, though, was the focus on hr strategies relating to knowledge\\n\\nworkers while not explicitly assessing the effectiveness of these for other employee groups.\\n\\nno strategy will be equally effective for all knowledge workers. rather, employers should\\n\\nrecognise the importance of individual needs, interests and aspirations (frost, 2002). \\n\\nthe bundles of practices for motivation and retention have more in common than those\\n\\nfound to be effective for attracting knowledge workers. consistent with butler and\\n\\nwaldrop (2001), hackman and oldham (1980), kinnear and sutherland (2000) and\\n\\nthompson and heron (2002), common practices for motivation and attraction relate to\\n\\nwork design and reorganisation, work challenge and personal control, and the need for\\n\\ntop management support. however, in contrast to a managerial orientation and implicit\\n\\nemployee passivity in work design, our ® ndings suggest strong support for the notion of\\n\\nj̀ob crafting’. this refers to the physical and cognitive changes individuals may make in\\n\\nthe task or relational boundaries of their work (wrzesniewski and dutton, 2001). here, the\\n\\nindividual has both the motivation and opportunity to job craft and construct particular\\n\\nwork relations and meanings affecting both work identity and organisational outcomes. \\n\\nturnover of knowledge workers is higher than among the rest of the workforce.  this is\\n\\nto be expected. strategies to balance the need for fresh talent and high turnover of these\\n\\nworkers in an industry where their competencies are scarce are important. satisfying\\n\\ncareer aspirations and providing a challenging work environment with more control and\\n\\nvoice over work arrangements would reduce voluntary turnover. this is consistent with\\n\\nthompson and heron (2002) and baron et al (2001), who ® nd that such turnover is also\\n\\nassociated with changes in employment models and hr blueprints embraced by\\n\\norganisational leaders.\\n\\nbased on our ® ndings of strategies that are highly effective in attracting, motivating\\n\\nand retaining knowledge workers, we propose a schema shown in figure 2. these\\n\\nrelationships between bundles of hr practices for attraction, motivation and retention\\n\\nare based on signi® cant correlations (p < .05) of highly effective practices. the schema\\n\\nmay be useful for managerial policy, further empirical research and model building. \\n\\nthere are three highly effective attraction strategies: offering a compensation package\\n\\nthat may include a sign-on bonus and funded further studies; a proactive recruitment\\n\\nprogramme using head hunters, targeted advertisements and on-campus recruitment,\\n\\nfocusing on those who are seen to fit into the culture easily; and internal filling of\\n\\npositions, based on a career plan that positions the employer as the choice employer; this\\n\\nis supplemented with an offer of a scholarship and a bond/service tie in return, but is\\n\\nonly effective for younger, entry-level recruits.\\n\\nthe three highly effective retention strategies require top management leadership and\\n\\nsupport. to sustain their continued employment, knowledge workers favour\\n\\nopportunities for growth, a conducive work environment and transparent compensation\\n\\nawards. however, these workers see share options as an opportunity to cash in to\\n\\nincrease their compensation, rather than ownership in the company. \\n\\nin terms of practical lessons for managers, motivation strategies may be clustered into\\n\\nfour main categories, which includes a regular communication system which keeps the\\n\\nworkers informed, especially by the top management; a conducive environment for\\n\\nwork; a compensation plan that is commensurate with their successful achievements; and\\n\\nopportunities for further career advancement. \\n\\nwhile this is a generic schema for knowledge workers from diverse industries, the\\n\\neffectiveness of each of these strategies may differ, depending on mediating variables\\n\\nsuch as organisational strategy, industry type, ownership structure and cross-cultural\\n\\nfactors. this supports a contingency approach (dowling et al, 1999). this schema is based\\n\\nfinders, keepers? attracting, motivating and retaining

a\\n\\nschema for attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers, hypothesis testing\\n\\nof this schema would enable a robust model to be developed. such research should focus\\n\\non particular industries, using larger samples. some of the reasons for the factors being\\n\\nhighly effective or ineffective were not well understood in the current research context.\\n\\nfor instance, in the electronics industry competitive pay appears to be almost the only\\n\\nhighly effective strategy to retain knowledge workers, with others being fairly effective or\\n\\nineffective. in some sectors using ¯ exible work practices for motivation and retention is\\n\\nlimited by a high degree of structure and work process type which permit less autonomy.\\n\\nhere firms have used other measures such as high investments in training and\\n\\ndevelopment and innovative career planning. the individual and organisational\\n\\nadvantages of ¯ exible work practices may also be mediated by the extent to which these\\n\\nwere voluntary or enforced cost reduction measures. the nature of our research tended to\\n\\nfavour formal hr strategies for attraction, motivation and retention. informal and more\\n\\nevolutionary hr processes and practices are often found in certain kifs. this might limit\\n\\nthe scope of the schema.  \\n\\ndirections for future research \\n\\nqualitative studies with focus groups and semi-structured interviews with selected policy\\n\\nmakers would throw more light on this area. our study was done in organisations in\\n\\nsingapore, employing mostly singaporeans. there may be a degree of cultural-boundedness\\n\\nin our ® ndings ±  for example, a claimed tendency of singaporeans to leave primarily for\\n\\nhigher pay. comparative cross-cultural research in east asian, european and other countries\\n\\ncould potentially establish the extent to which bundles of hr strategies and specific\\n\\npractices for attracting, motivating and retaining knowledge workers are convergent or\\n\\ndivergent. cross-cultural research could also determine the impact of cultural variables on\\n\\nthe choice of particular hr practices for managing knowledge workers. variations in local\\n\\ncontext, such as workforce demography/diversity and regiocentric factors could be\\n\\nconsidered (heenen and perlmutter, 1979).\\n\\nhr systems may vary depending on country of ownership of the firm. some\\n\\ndifferences were found between wholly owned singaporean and foreign-owned\\n\\ncompanies. the so-called `war for talent’ is not unique to south-east asia. it is a global\\n\\nphenomenon. with singapore’s policy of striving to become a t̀alent capital’ actively\\n\\nseeking to recruit foreign talent, it also represents a microcosm of a broader challenge for\\n\\norganisations in europe and elsewhere in addressing the challenge of managing talented\\n\\npeople. notwithstanding cyclical economic downturns and ® nancial crises aggravated by\\n\\nglobal political events, the advance of technological change and knowledge work will\\n\\nincreasingly focus attention on how best to attract and manage knowledge workers.\\n\\nacknowledgement\\n\\nthe
