employees acknowl disconnection between their own long-term\\ncareer development goals and thals of their employer. a lack of trust in the employer’s\\nability, or willingness, to provide long-term job security leads to a focus on protecting one’s\\nown career interests (feldman, 1985, 1989; feldman and weitz, 1991). importantly, such career\\ncommitment has been shown to have significant negative implications for a variety of\\nimportant work attitudes and behaviours, including job involvement and commitment (\\naryee and chen, 2004).\\n\\nkanter (1990), and more recently herriot and pemberton (1996, 1997), present a solution to\\nthis dilemma. employers need to provide employees with a range of career development\\nopportunities that promote their employability security. in other words, an economic exchange\\nmodel is proposed where employee loyalty and high performance (albeit perhaps over the short\\nterm) is generated through the provision of valued and marketable career development\\nopportunities (herriot and pemberton, 1996, 1997; sturges , 2005). organisations may\\ntherefore be able to reduce the emnce of damaging careerist orientations to work and\\ngarner the required levels of work performance, in particular proactive behaviours, by\\nproviding employees with valued and satisfying career development opportunities.\\n\\nto date, however, empirical support for these propositions is limited. despite the obvious\\nsalience of proactive behaviour and careerist orientation, they have been largely overlooked by\\ncareer researchers investigating employee perceptions of, and reactions to, their career\\ndevelopment opportunities. the authors could find no previous empirical studies exploring the\\nrelationship between employee perceptions of their career development opportunities and their\\nproactive behaviour. moreover, only one published study, carried out within the chinese\\nmanufacturing context, could be found that has investigated the relationship between employee\\nperceptions of their career development opportunities and careerist orientation (see aryee and\\nchen, 2004).\\n\\ntheoretically, the extant careers literature has also been dominated by simple exchange\\nmodels such as the one posited above ( aryee and chen, 2004). although useful, researchers\\nhave yet to explore the conditions under which employees’ perceptions of career development\\nopportunities may matter more (or less) in predicting important outcomes such as proactive\\nbehaviour and careerist orientation. in other words, research is needed that investigates the\\nexistence of moderators of the relationship between career development opportunities and\\nimportant outcomes. if we are to more effectively inform current and future policy making and\\npractice in organisational career management, it is essential therefore that research begins to\\nexplore important contextual variables that may impact upon employees’ reactions to career\\ndevelopment opportunities.\\n\\nin order to meet thesps in the current careers literature, we turned to organisational\\njustice theory, and in particular, recent findings that suggest employee reactions to\\norganisational decisions ( the allocation of career development opportunities) may be\\nmoderated by a three-way interaction between the perceived favourability of reward/resource\\nallocations, their perceptions of procedural justice, or the fairness of the organisations’ decision-\\nmaking processes (leventhal, 1980) regarding these decisions, and their affective organisational\\ncommitment ( kwong and leung, 2002). kwong and leung found support for such an\\ninteraction effect when predicting employee work effort and stay intentions. when employees\\nviewed the allocation of valued rewards and resources as unfavourable, the moderating effect\\nof high procedural justice on work effort and stay intentions was found to be more pronounced\\nin employees who reported high organisational commitment.\\n\\nin light of these findings, we propose and test a similar model, where careerist orientation\\nand proactive behaviour are predicted by an interaction between employee perceptions of their\\n\\njonathan r. crawshaw, rolf van dick and felix c. brodbeck\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1, 2012 5\\n\\n© 2011 blackwell publishing ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\ncareer development opportunities (a resource allocation), the perceived fairness of the\\nprocedures used to decide them and their affective organisational commitment. more\\nspecifically, we hypothesise that when employees perceive their career development\\nopportunities unfavourably, the negative implications for proactive behaviour and careerist\\norientation will be lessened if the decision-making procedures are perceived as fair and their\\ncommitment is high.\\n\\nwe aim at making contributions to both the careers and organisational justice literatures. the\\ncareers literature is provided with much needed empirical research exploring the importance\\nof employee perceptions of career development opportunities for two new dependent variables,\\nproactive behaviour and careerist orientation. moreover, a new organisational justice-based\\ntheoretical lens through which to understand employee reactions to their career development\\nopportunities is also presented. although recent research has begun to recognise the potential\\nimportance of organisational justice in a career management context, this literature is still\\nlimited in its empirical scope and theoretical development ( wooten and cobb, 1999; aryee\\nand chen, 2004; crawshaw, 2006; crawshaw and brodbeck, 2011).\\n\\nthe organisational justice literature is provided with a much needed replication of the\\ninteraction between outcome favourability, procedural justice and affective organisational\\ncommitment within a new uk career management context. to our knowl, no subsequent\\nstudy has presented additional empirical evidence of this three-way interaction effect, and as\\nsuch, this study aims to increase confidence in thneralisability and utility of kwong and\\nleung’s findings.\\n\\ncareer development opportunities, careerism and proactive behaviour\\n\\nthe positivins for organisations of providing employees with satisfying and rewarding\\ncareer development opportunities are fairly well established. for example, a number of prior\\nstudies have highlighted the significant relationships between perceived career development\\nopportunities and positive work attitudes such as job satisfaction (birdi , 1997; chen ,\\n2003) and organisational commitment (blau , 2001). to date, however, this research has\\nbeen fairly limited in its range of dependent variables studied.\\n\\nas highlighted above, the emnce of more careerist-orientated employees may provide\\nmany problems for employers, not least the potential for lower job performance and increased\\nturnover (feldman and weitz, 1991). given the assumptions that a lack of long-term career\\ndevelopment opportunities may be a key antecedent of careerist orientation, it is perhaps\\nsurprising that very few studies have actually explored this relationship. aryee and chen\\n(2004) provide some support for a significant negative relationship between career growth\\nopportunities and careerist orientation but the specific chinese context of their research means\\nthat more evidence is needed, and in different employment contexts.\\n\\nanother significant absentee has been research exploring the impact of perceived career\\ndevelopment opportunities on employee job performance. kraimer  (2010) present some\\nempirical support for the positive relationship between career opportunities and role-based\\nperformance. however, again, more evidence is required that focuses on other important\\naspects of work performance such as employee proactive or extra-role behaviour. it is essential\\nthat more research is carried out that explores the links between career variables, such as\\nperceived career development opportunities, and outcomes that are valued by senior\\nmanagement in organisations (kraimer , 2010). by focussing our study on employee\\ncareerist orientation and proactive behaviour, we aimed to begin to fill this gap in the literature.\\n\\ncareer motivation theory (london, 1983) and social exchange theory (blau, 1964) have both\\nemd as frameworks for understanding these relationships. career motivation theory posits\\n\\ninteractions of commitment and justice\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1, 20126\\n\\n© 2011 blackwell publishing ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\nthat an individual’s work attitudes and behaviours are, to some extent, motivated by their\\npersonal career goals. thus, employees increase their effort and commitment to the attainment\\nof organisational goals because they wish to gain access to valuable career development\\nopportunities that are on offer (kraimer , 2010). alternatively, social exchange theory is\\nbased on the principles of reciprocity, where employees’ increase their commitment and work\\neffort in response to positive treatment by the organisation – like the receipt of valuable career\\ndevelopment opportunities ( aryee and chen, 2004). either way, both theories posit a\\nsignificant positive relationship between the perceived favourability of career development\\nopportunities and individual proactive behaviour and a significant negative relationship\\nbetween the perceived favourability of career development opportunities and careerist\\norientation.\\n\\nthe current study, however, extends these theoretical models, and prior empirical research,\\nby exploring the existence of important moderators of these relationships. to this end, we draw\\nupon research from the field of organisational justice, and in particular, a study by kwong and\\nleung (2002) that finds support for a three-way interaction effect between the perceived\\nfavourability of outcomes, procedural justice and affective organisational commitment.\\n\\nthe interaction of perceived career development opportunities, procedural justice and\\n\\naffective commitment\\n\\nconsiderable empirical support has emd within the organisational justice literature for an\\ninteraction effect between an individual’s perceptions of procedural justice and outcome\\nfavourability when predicting his/her reactions to a decision-making system (for a meta-\\nanalysis, see brockner and wiesenfeld, 1996). studies have repeatedly shown that an\\nemployee’s concerns for procedural justice areater when they feel that they have been\\ntreated unfavourably in the distribution of valued rewards or resources ( folger, 1987).\\nwhen outcomes are viewed unfavourably, the potential negative implications for important\\norganisation-directed attitudes and behaviours appear to be ‘offset’ or ‘buffered’ by the\\npresence of high levels of procedural fairness (for reviews, see brockner and wiesenfeld, 1996;\\ncropanzano and greenb 1997; colquitt , 2001).\\n\\ntwo explanations for the interaction of procedural justice and outcome favourability have\\nbeen put forward. from an instrumental perspective, procedural justice is viewed as evidence\\nof one’s potential future economic gain from that decision-making system. if the procedures\\nfollowed to make the unfavourable decision are viewed as fair and just it is proposed that the\\nindividual is, at least in part, reassured that this system and relationship should ultimately\\nbenefit them, economically speaking, over the longer term (lind and tyler, 1988). the potential\\nnegative attitudinal or behavioural implications associated with unfavourable reward allocation\\nare thus offset as current decisions are viewed by the individual as less important than the\\npotential economic gains from the longer term relationship.\\n\\nalternatively, the ‘group value’, or relational, perspective draws on social identity theory\\n(tajfel and turner, 1986) and interprets this interaction effect as reflecting an individual’s\\ndesire to be accepted by their peer or working group (tyler, 1989). being subjected to fair and\\njust procedures suggests one is valued and respected within thoup, irrespective of the\\nrelative unfavourability of the current rewards and resources provided by thoup.\\nalthough a desire for in-group acceptance may also be deemed as instrumental, the\\nmotivation here is not mainly for economic gain or benefit, but mostly for meeting\\nrelationship and social needs. the potential negative implications for individual attitudes or\\nbehaviours associated with the receipt of unfavourable rewards or resources are thus offset,\\nnot because procedural justicarantees future economic gain, but because one’s desires for\\n\\njonathan r. crawshaw, rolf van dick and felix c. brodbeck\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1, 2012 7\\n\\n© 2011 blackwell publishing ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\nsocial group acceptance and respect are upheld (tyler and bies, 1990; tyler and lind, 1992;\\nblader and tyler, 2009).\\n\\na study by kwong and leung (2002) has, however, presented some evidence that this\\ninteraction is itself contingent on the degree of importance an individual places on their\\nrelationship with the decision-making system. drawing on earlier research ( brockner ,\\n1992, 2000; tyler and degoey, 1996), kwong and leung suggest that procedural justice may\\nonly matter to individuals when the relationship with the decision maker itself matters and is\\nvalued. in other words, one has to care about one’s relationship with their employer, to\\nultimately care about how you are treated by them. the compensatory or ‘buffering’ effect of\\nprocedural justice on outcome unfavourability would therefore only be observed when an\\nindividual identifies with and is affectively committed to their organisation.\\n\\nin their study of 151 chinese members of the hong kong retail union, and their reactions\\nto a pay freeze decision, kwong and leung found support for this proposed three-way\\ninteraction. perceptions of procedural justice, in relation to the pay freeze decision, were found\\nto be more strongly and positively related to employee work effort and stay intentions when\\nthe outcome was perceived unfavourably and employee organisational commitment was high\\n(kwong and leung, 2002). put differently, the negative implications of a pay freeze decision for\\nwork effort and stay intentions was offset by the perceived fairness of the procedures used to\\ndecide this pay freeze, but only when employees were committed to their organisation. as\\nprocedural justice only moderates the negative implications of unfavourable rewards under\\nconditions of high organisational commitment, kwong and leung conclude that these findings\\npresent support for the relational or ‘group value’, rather than instrumental and economic,\\nperspective on procedural justice. one has to care about one’s organisation (high organisational\\ncommitment) before any evaluation on the fairness of its decision-making procedures matters.\\n\\ndrawing on these findings, therefore, we propose that an employee’s careerist orientation\\nand proactive behaviour will be predicted by a three-way interaction between the perceived\\nfavourability of career development opportunities, perceptions of procedural justice and\\norganisational commitment. more specifically, when an individual views the procedures for\\nallocating career development opportunities as fair, this will ‘offset’ or ‘buffer’ the potential\\nnegative implications for their proactive behaviour and careerist orientation caused by\\nunfavourable career development opportunities, but only when the individual is committed to,\\nor identifies with, their organisation. the following hypotheses are therefore proposed:\\n\\nhypothesis 1: when employees view their career development opportunities unfavourably\\n(rather than favourably), perceptions of procedural justice will be strongly and positively\\nrelated to proactive behaviour, but only when organisational commitment is high.\\n\\nhypothesis 2: when employees view their career development opportunities unfavourably\\n(rather than favourably), perceptions of procedural justice will be strongly and negatively\\nrelated to careerist orientation, but only when organisational commitment is high.\\n\\nin sum, the present study aims to replicate the findings of kwong and leung within a new\\ncareer context, thus increasing confidence in their generalisability and utility. moreover, the\\nsalience of the ‘group value’ model, rather than the instrumental/economic model, of\\nprocedural justice is also further tested within our study. finally, by exploring the moderating\\neffects of two key contextual variables (affective organisational commitment and procedural\\njustice) on the relationship between career development opportunities and proactive behaviour\\nand careerist orientation, managers and hr practitioners are provided with a new insight into\\nthe dynamics of managing the career development of their employees.\\n\\ninteractions of commitment and justice\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1,

findings render essential theoretical developments in the careers literature regarding the\\nrole of injustice perceptions in employee evaluations of, and reactions to, organisational career\\nmanagement policies and practices. past research applying organisational justice theory to a\\ncareer context has been dominated by simple exchange models that assume the fair distribution\\nof career development opportunities and the use of fair decision-making procedures will be\\nreciprocated by positive employee attitudes and behaviours (see wooten and cobb, 1999; aryee\\nand chen, 2004; crawshaw, 2006). the current study presents empirical support for a more\\ncomplex set of cognitions when it comes to employee reactions to the career development\\nopportunities offered, highlighting the interaction effects of outcome favourability, procedural\\njustice and organisational commitment when predicting an individual’s careerist orientation\\nand proactive behaviour.\\n\\nthis study also provides important empirical testing of the relationships between employee\\nperceptions of their career development opportunities and individual proactive behaviour.\\n\\nfigure 2 simple slope analysis with careerist orientation as dependent variable\\n\\njonathan r. crawshaw, rolf van dick and felix c. brodbeck\\n\\nhuman resource

and behaviours that are essential for organisational survival and prosperity,\\nand increasingly individual innovation and proactivity are viewed as such (crant, 2000; parker\\n, 2006). to the authors’ best knowl, no study exists that has explored the role of career\\nmanagement and career development in promoting such behaviours. initial, tentative, support\\nis provided here for the important roles that the provision of career development opportunities\\nand fair career management procedures may play in promoting individual proactivity.\\n\\nthe organisational justice literature is presented with further testing of the three-way\\ninteraction effect between outcome favourability, procedural justice and organisational\\ncommitment first proposed by kwong and leung (2002). by confirming this within a new\\nnational (uk) and work (career management) context, and on new previously untested\\ndependent variables (proactive behaviour and careerist orientation), this article provides\\nimportant evidence of thneralisability of these effects. not only are these effects apparently\\nimportant within the contexts of pay negotiations and pay freeze decisions in china (kwong and\\nleung, 2002), there is now evidence that they may also be central to the effective management,\\nby employers, of the careers and career development opportunities of uk employees.\\n\\nthese findings also further enhance kwong and leung’s theoretical proposition that a\\nrelational rather than instrumental (economic) perspective on procedural justice may be more\\nrelevant when trying to understand employee reactions to their employers’ policies and\\ndecision making. the fact that procedural justice only appears to matter when an individual\\nvalues the relationship with their employer strongly counters an instrumental, economic,\\nperspective on procedural justice. this is particularly interesting within the context of\\nmanaging careers, where recent thinking has tended towards the emnce of a transactional\\npsychological momentum in the employment relationship (see herriot and pemberton, 1996,\\n1997; robinson, 1996). within this context, careers and career management are viewed as an\\neconomic, short-term and instrumental transaction, where high performance and flexibility is\\nexchanged for access to transferable and marketable skills (herriot and pemberton, 1996, 1997).\\nwithin the organisation investigated in the present study, however, relational concerns in the\\nemployment contract still appear to be an important and central factor in governing employee\\nreactions to organisational or managerial decisions regarding their career development.\\n\\nlimitations and future research\\n\\nthe contributions of this research should be viewed in light of a number of potential\\nmethodological limitations, which are presented here as possible opportunities for future\\nresearch and methodological development. first, all data collected within this study was\\nself-reported, and as such, raises the potential problems of common method bias in the\\nfindings. that said, it is commonly felt that concerns of common method bias may not\\nnecessarily apply to tests of moderation, with several authors suggesting that common method\\nbias may actually work against the detection of interaction effects, suppressing their emnce\\nin the data analysis ( mcclelland and judd, 1993). in line with a recent demonstration by\\nsiemsen  (2011), the existence of reliable three-way interaction effects within the present\\nstudy suggests that common method bias may not be a major problem. despite this, it would\\nbe useful for future research to investigate these issues using more ‘objective’ data to avoid\\npotential same source bias. for example, supervisor/line manager evaluations of proactive\\nbehaviour could be sought, whereas for careerist orientation self-report seems to be more\\nappropriate.\\n\\nsecond, data was collected at a single point in time. the cross-sectional design of this\\nresearch thus limits our ability to confirm the causal direction of hypotheses. for example, it\\n\\ninteractions of commitment and justice\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1, 201216\\n\\n© 2011 blackwell publishing ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\nmay be conceivable that those employees who are more careerist orientated are more likely to\\nrate their career development opportunities as unfavourable and organisational procedures as\\nunfair. our model, however, is very much in line with the theoretical developments within the\\norganisational justice literature and our findings confirm those of previous research ( kwong\\nand leung, 2002). that said, future studies may look to build upon this research by using more\\nlongitudinal designs to explore these interaction effects.\\n\\nthird, the single organisation focus of this study reduces thneralisability of these\\nfindings to individuals not employed by this company. despite confirming the findings of\\nprevious studies, it is essential that future research is carried out in different national and\\norganisational contexts to further generateater confidence in their generalisability.\\n\\nfinally, within this study, participants were asked for their overall or general opinions\\nregarding the favourability of their career development opportunities, and the fairness of the\\nprocedures used to decide this. this ‘averaging’ of experiences might be problematic, as for\\nexample, procedures used to decide promotional opportunities and those used to decide access\\nto a secondment may include very different agents and processes. despite this, the current\\nstudy is in line with previous research investigating such issues ( brockner , 1997; aryee\\nand chen, 2004), and as such, confidence should be taken in the appropriateness and accuracy\\nof this data. however, future research may begin to focus on more specific career management\\ninterventions like reactions to promotional decisions or outcomes of mentoring relationships,\\nthereby potentially alleviating these problems of ‘averaging’.\\n\\nimplications for practice\\n\\ndespite the limitations discussed above, our results suggest a number of important practical\\nimplications. there are times when employers may be unable to provide the kinds of career\\ndevelopment opportunities desired by their employees, perhaps in periods of economic\\nhardship and recession. at such times, employees are liable to become frustrated with their\\ncareer development opportunities and are more likely to view them unfavourably. it is under\\nthese conditions that individual proactivity may be threatened, ironically when it may be\\nneeded most for organisational survival, and more careerist orientations to work may begin to\\nem. the results of this study show careerism may be averted and proactive behaviours\\nmaintained, even if career development opportunities are viewed unfavourably, if employers\\nensure that their procedures for allocating career development opportunities are viewed as fair\\nand their employees’ organisational commitment has been upheld.\\n\\none, of course, could view this scenario differently. that in times of economic hardship and\\nrecession, a lack of alternative work opportunities may lead employees to exhibit more\\nproactive behaviours in order to signal their value to the organisation. in this case, it is high\\nlevels of continuance commitment (meyer and allen, 1984) that is proposed as a driver for\\nproactive behaviour. although our study does not explicitly test the moderating role of\\ncontinuance commitment, we do present good evidence that the affective ‘want to’ aspect of\\norganisational commitment is essential for securing proactive behaviour when desirable career\\ndevelopment opportunities are unavailable.\\n\\nit is important, therefore, that employers attract and maintain a committed workforce. much\\nwork has already been done on the roles of high-commitment or high-performance work\\npractices and hrm strategies in promoting employee gement and organisational\\ncommitment ( huselid, 1995). this literature presents strong support for the various roles\\nplayed by effective recruitment, job design, employee involvement mechanisms, reward\\nstrategies and performance management systems in promoting the high levels of affective\\ncommitment required from one’s employees (see ichniowski , 1997; riketta , 2006).\\n\\njonathan r. crawshaw, rolf van dick and felix c. brodbeck\\n\\nhuman resource management journal, vol 22 no 1, 2012 17\\n\\n© 2011 blackwell publishing ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\nat the same time, it is equally important that managers and supervisors are made aware of\\nthe importance of fair processes and procedures in the allocation of career development\\nopportunities, and that they gain the necessary experience of facilitating and supporting the\\ncareers of their employees. such decision-making processes (and therefore any relevant\\ntraining) should uphold the principles of procedural justice by being transparent, consistent,\\nallowing employee input and influence, suppressing bias and being based on accurate and\\nrelevant information (leventhal, 1980). employees should also be provided with regular\\ncommunications regarding their career development and bven quality and timely feedback\\non any career-related decisions affecting them (bies and moag, 1986).\\n'"

group aston business school aston university birmingham et uk. email hrmj. introduction mployers face dilemma. on the one hand there is growing opinion that if organisations are to survive and prosper it will be through the development and retention of highly skilled and high-performing workforce. indeed within the context of an increasingly competitive dynamic and unpredictable work environment particular attention has been paid to the importance of developing employees who are willing and able to work proactively. proactive employees are said to exhibit the necessary innovativeness future orientation and self-motivation required to add real value to organisations facing these difficult challs. on the other hand however these very same external forces have led many organisations to initiate strategies to improve their flexibility and efficiency in order to remain competitive. such strategies commonly involve significant re-organisation of work very often involving regular rounds of redundancy the introduction of short term flexible contracting and or the outsourcing of non-core functions. rather than promoting proactive workforce such strategies have been shown to undermine trust in the employment relationship and support the emnce of more careerist-orientated employee. doi. -human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. please cite this article in press as crawshaw.  van dick. and brodbeck.  opportunity fair process and relationship value career development as driver of proactive work behaviour. human resource management journal. careerist-orientated employees acknowl disconnection between their own long-term career development goals and thals of their employer. lack of trust in the employer ability or willingness to provide long-term job security leads to focus on protecting one own career interests. importantly such career commitment has been shown to have significant negative implications for variety of important work attitudes and behaviours including job involvement and commitment. kanter and more recently herriot and pemberton present solution to this dilemma. employers need to provide employees with range of career development opportunities that promote their employability security. in other words an economic exchange model is proposed where employee loyalty and high performance is generated through the provision of valued and marketable career development opportunities. organisations may therefore be able to reduce the emnce of damaging careerist orientations to work and garner the required levels of work performance in particular proactive behaviours by providing employees with valued and satisfying career development opportunities. to date however empirical support for these propositions is limited. despite the obvious salience of proactive behaviour and careerist orientation they have been largely overlooked by career researchers investigating employee perceptions of and reactions to their career development opportunities. the authors could find no previous empirical studies exploring the relationship between employee perceptions of their career development opportunities and their proactive behaviour. moreover only one published study carried out within the chinese manufacturing context could be found that has investigated the relationship between employee perceptions of their career development opportunities and careerist orientation. theoretically the extant careers literature has also been dominated by simple exchange models such as the one posited above. although useful researchers have yet to explore the conditions under which employees perceptions of career development opportunities may matter more in predicting important outcomes such as proactive behaviour and careerist orientation. in other words research is needed that investigates the existence of moderators of the relationship between career development opportunities and important outcomes. if we are to more effectively inform current and future policy making and practice in organisational career management it is essential therefore that research begins to explore important contextual variables that may impact upon employees reactions to career development opportunities. in order to meet thesps in the current careers literature we turned to organisational justice theory and in particular recent findings that suggest employee reactions to organisational decisions may be moderated by three-way interaction between the perceived favourability of reward resource allocations their perceptions of procedural justice or the fairness of the organisations decisionmaking processes regarding these decisions and their affective organisational commitment. kwong and leung found support for such an interaction effect when predicting employee work effort and stay intentions. when employees viewed the allocation of valued rewards and resources as unfavourable the moderating effect of high procedural justice on work effort and stay intentions was found to be more pronounced in employees who reported high organisational commitment. in light of these findings we propose and test similar model where careerist orientation and proactive behaviour are predicted by an interaction between employee perceptions of their jonathan. crawshaw rolf van dick and felix. brodbeck human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. career development opportunities the perceived fairness of the procedures used to decide them and their affective organisational commitment. more specifically we hypothesise that when employees perceive their career development opportunities unfavourably the negative implications for proactive behaviour and careerist orientation will be lessened if the decision-making procedures are perceived as fair and their commitment is high. we aim at making contributions to both the careers and organisational justice literatures. the careers literature is provided with much needed empirical research exploring the importance of employee perceptions of career development opportunities for two new dependent variables proactive behaviour and careerist orientation. moreover new organisational justice-based theoretical lens through which to understand employee reactions to their career development opportunities is also presented. although recent research has begun to recognise the potential importance of organisational justice in career management context this literature is still limited in its empirical scope and theoretical development. the organisational justice literature is provided with much needed replication of the interaction between outcome favourability procedural justice and affective organisational commitment within new uk career management context. to our knowl no subsequent study has presented additional empirical evidence of this three-way interaction effect and as such this study aims to increase confidence in thneralisability and utility of kwong and leung findings. career development opportunities careerism and proactive behaviour the positivins for organisations of providing employees with satisfying and rewarding career development opportunities are fairly well established. for example number of prior studies have highlighted the significant relationships between perceived career development opportunities and positive work attitudes such as job satisfaction and organisational commitment. to date however this research has been fairly limited in its range of dependent variables studied. as highlighted above the emnce of more careerist-orientated employees may provide many problems for employers not least the potential for lower job performance and increased turnover. given the assumptions that lack of long-term career development opportunities may be key antecedent of careerist orientation it is perhaps surprising that very few studies have actually explored this relationship. aryee and chen provide some support for significant negative relationship between career growth opportunities and careerist orientation but the specific chinese context of their research means that more evidence is needed and in different employment contexts. another significant absentee has been research exploring the impact of perceived career development opportunities on employee job performance. kraimer present some empirical support for the positive relationship between career opportunities and role-based performance. however again more evidence is required that focuses on other important aspects of work performance such as employee proactive or extra-role behaviour. it is essential that more research is carried out that explores the links between career variables such as perceived career development opportunities and outcomes that are valued by senior management in organisations. by focussing our study on employee careerist orientation and proactive behaviour we aimed to begin to fill this gap in the literature. career motivation theory and social exchange theory have both emd as frameworks for understanding these relationships. career motivation theory posits interactions of commitment and justice human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. that an individual work attitudes and behaviours are to some extent motivated by their personal career goals. thus employees increase their effort and commitment to the attainment of organisational goals because they wish to gain access to valuable career development opportunities that are on offer. alternatively social exchange theory is based on the principles of reciprocity where employees increase their commitment and work effort in response to positive treatment by the organisation like the receipt of valuable career development opportunities. either way both theories posit significant positive relationship between the perceived favourability of career development opportunities and individual proactive behaviour and significant negative relationship between the perceived favourability of career development opportunities and careerist orientation. the current study however extends these theoretical models and prior empirical research by exploring the existence of important moderators of these relationships. to this end we draw upon research from the field of organisational justice and in particular study by kwong and leung that finds support for three-way interaction effect between the perceived favourability of outcomes procedural justice and affective organisational commitment. the interaction of perceived career development opportunities procedural justice and affective commitment considerable empirical support has emd within the organisational justice literature for an interaction effect between an individual perceptions of procedural justice and outcome favourability when predicting his her reactions to decision-making system. studies have repeatedly shown that an employee concerns for procedural justice areater when they feel that they have been treated unfavourably in the distribution of valued rewards or resources. when outcomes are viewed unfavourably the potential negative implications for important organisation-directed attitudes and behaviours appear to be offset or buffered by the presence of high levels of procedural fairness. two explanations for the interaction of procedural justice and outcome favourability have been put forward. from an instrumental perspective procedural justice is viewed as evidence of one potential future economic gain from that decision-making system. if the procedures followed to make the unfavourable decision are viewed as fair and just it is proposed that the individual is at least in part reassured that this system and relationship should ultimately benefit them economically speaking over the longer term. the potential negative attitudinal or behavioural implications associated with unfavourable reward allocation are thus offset as current decisions are viewed by the individual as less important than the potential economic gains from the longer term relationship. alternatively the group value or relational perspective draws on social identity theory and interprets this interaction effect as reflecting an individual desire to be accepted by their peer or working group. being subjected to fair and just procedures suggests one is valued and respected within thoup irrespective of the relative unfavourability of the current rewards and resources provided by thoup. although desire for in-group acceptance may also be deemed as instrumental the motivation here is not mainly for economic gain or benefit but mostly for meeting relationship and social needs. the potential negative implications for individual attitudes or behaviours associated with the receipt of unfavourable rewards or resources are thus offset not because procedural justicarantees future economic gain but because one desires for jonathan. crawshaw rolf van dick and felix. brodbeck human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. social group acceptance and respect are upheld. study by kwong and leung has however presented some evidence that this interaction is itself contingent on the degree of importance an individual places on their relationship with the decision-making system. drawing on earlier research kwong and leung suggest that procedural justice may only matter to individuals when the relationship with the decision maker itself matters and is valued. in other words one has to care about one relationship with their employer to ultimately care about how you are treated by them. the compensatory or buffering effect of procedural justice on outcome unfavourability would therefore only be observed when an individual identifies with and is affectively committed to their organisation. in their study of chinese members of the hong kong retail union and their reactions to pay freeze decision kwong and leung found support for this proposed three-way interaction. perceptions of procedural justice in relation to the pay freeze decision were found to be more strongly and positively related to employee work effort and stay intentions when the outcome was perceived unfavourably and employee organisational commitment was high. put differently the negative implications of pay freeze decision for work effort and stay intentions was offset by the perceived fairness of the procedures used to decide this pay freeze but only when employees were committed to their organisation. as procedural justice only moderates the negative implications of unfavourable rewards under conditions of high organisational commitment kwong and leung conclude that these findings present support for the relational or group value rather than instrumental and economic perspective on procedural justice. one has to care about one organisation before any evaluation on the fairness of its decision-making procedures matters. drawing on these findings therefore we propose that an employee careerist orientation and proactive behaviour will be predicted by three-way interaction between the perceived favourability of career development opportunities perceptions of procedural justice and organisational commitment. more specifically when an individual views the procedures for allocating career development opportunities as fair this will offset or buffer the potential negative implications for their proactive behaviour and careerist orientation caused by unfavourable career development opportunities but only when the individual is committed to or identifies with their organisation. the following hypotheses are therefore proposed hypothesis when employees view their career development opportunities unfavourably perceptions of procedural justice will be strongly and positively related to proactive behaviour but only when organisational commitment is high. hypothesis when employees view their career development opportunities unfavourably perceptions of procedural justice will be strongly and negatively related to careerist orientation but only when organisational commitment is high. in sum the present study aims to replicate the findings of kwong and leung within new career context thus increasing confidence in their generalisability and utility. moreover the salience of the group value model rather than the instrumental economic model of procedural justice is also further tested within our study. finally by exploring the moderating effects of two key contextual variables on the relationship between career development opportunities and proactive behaviour and careerist orientation managers and hr practitioners are provided with new insight into the dynamics of managing the career development of their employees. interactions of commitment and justice human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. our key hypotheses were supported. when individuals view their career development opportunities unfavourably their

ability of procedural justice perceptions to suppress or buffer the negative implications of unfavourable career development opportunities for proactive behaviour and careerist orientation is only apparent when an individual values the relationship with their employer. implications for theory these findings render essential theoretical developments in the careers literature regarding the role of injustice perceptions in employee evaluations of and reactions to organisational career management policies and practices. past research applying organisational justice theory to career context has been dominated by simple exchange models that assume the fair distribution of career development opportunities and the use of fair decision-making procedures will be reciprocated by positive employee attitudes and behaviours. the current study presents empirical support for more complex set of cognitions when it comes to employee reactions to the career development opportunities offered highlighting the interaction effects of outcome favourability procedural justice and organisational commitment when predicting an individual careerist orientation and proactive behaviour. this study also provides important empirical testing of the relationships between employee perceptions of their career development opportunities and individual proactive behaviour. figure simple slope analysis

proactivity are viewed as such. to the authors best knowl no study exists that has explored the role of career management and career development in promoting such behaviours. initial tentative support is provided here for the important roles that the provision of career development opportunities and fair career management procedures may play in promoting individual proactivity. the organisational justice literature is presented with further testing of the three-way interaction effect between outcome favourability procedural justice and organisational commitment first proposed by kwong and leung. by confirming this within new national and work context and on new previously untested dependent variables this article provides important evidence of thneralisability of these effects. not only are these effects apparently important within the contexts of pay negotiations and pay freeze decisions in china there is now evidence that they may also be central to the effective management by employers of the careers and career development opportunities of uk employees. these findings also further enhance kwong and leung theoretical proposition that relational rather than instrumental perspective on procedural justice may be more relevant when trying to understand employee reactions to their employers policies and decision making. the fact that procedural justice only appears to matter when an individual values the relationship with their employer strongly counters an instrumental economic perspective on procedural justice. this is particularly interesting within the context of managing careers where recent thinking has tended towards the emnce of transactional psychological momentum in the employment relationship. within this context careers and career management are viewed as an economic short-term and instrumental transaction where high performance and flexibility is exchanged for access to transferable and marketable skills. within the organisation investigated in the present study however relational concerns in the employment contract still appear to be an important and central factor in governing employee reactions to organisational or managerial decisions regarding their career development. limitations and future research the contributions of this research should be viewed in light of number of potential methodological limitations which are presented here as possible opportunities for future research and methodological development. first all data collected within this study was self-reported and as such raises the potential problems of common method bias in the findings. that said it is commonly felt that concerns of common method bias may not necessarily apply to tests of moderation with several authors suggesting that common method bias may actually work against the detection of interaction effects suppressing their emnce in the data analysis. in line with recent demonstration by siemsen the existence of reliable three-way interaction effects within the present study suggests that common method bias may not be major problem. despite this it would be useful for future research to investigate these issues using more objective data to avoid potential same source bias. for example supervisor line manager evaluations of proactive behaviour could be sought whereas for careerist orientation self-report seems to be more appropriate. second data was collected at single point in time. the cross-sectional design of this research thus limits our ability to confirm the causal direction of hypotheses. for example it interactions of commitment and justice human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. may be conceivable that those employees who are more careerist orientated are more likely to rate their career development opportunities as unfavourable and organisational procedures as unfair. our model however is very much in line with the theoretical developments within the organisational justice literature and our findings confirm those of previous research. that said future studies may look to build upon this research by using more longitudinal designs to explore these interaction effects. third the single organisation focus of this study reduces thneralisability of these findings to individuals not employed by this company. despite confirming the findings of previous studies it is essential that future research is carried out in different national and organisational contexts to further generateater confidence in their generalisability. finally within this study participants were asked for their overall or general opinions regarding the favourability of their career development opportunities and the fairness of the procedures used to decide this. this averaging of experiences might be problematic as for example procedures used to decide promotional opportunities and those used to decide access to secondment may include very different agents and processes. despite this the current study is in line with previous research investigating such issues and as such confidence should be taken in the appropriateness and accuracy of this data. however future research may begin to focus on more specific career management interventions like reactions to promotional decisions or outcomes of mentoring relationships thereby potentially alleviating these problems of averaging. implications for practice despite the limitations discussed above our results suggest number of important practical implications. there are times when employers may be unable to provide the kinds of career development opportunities desired by their employees perhaps in periods of economic hardship and recession. at such times employees are liable to become frustrated with their career development opportunities and are more likely to view them unfavourably. it is under these conditions that individual proactivity may be threatened ironically when it may be needed most for organisational survival and more careerist orientations to work may begin to em. the results of this study show careerism may be averted and proactive behaviours maintained even if career development opportunities are viewed unfavourably if employers ensure that their procedures for allocating career development opportunities are viewed as fair and their employees organisational commitment has been upheld. one of course could view this scenario differently. that in times of economic hardship and recession lack of alternative work opportunities may lead employees to exhibit more proactive behaviours in order to signal their value to the organisation. in this case it is high levels of continuance commitment that is proposed as driver for proactive behaviour. although our study does not explicitly test the moderating role of continuance commitment we do present good evidence that the affective want to aspect of organisational commitment is essential for securing proactive behaviour when desirable career development opportunities are unavailable. it is important therefore that employers attract and maintain committed workforce. much work has already been done on the roles of high-commitment or high-performance work practices and hrm strategies in promoting employee gement and organisational commitment. this literature presents strong support for the various roles played by effective recruitment job design employee involvement mechanisms reward strategies and performance management systems in promoting the high levels of affective commitment required from one employees. jonathan. crawshaw rolf van dick and felix. brodbeck human resource management journal vol no blackwell publishing ltd. at the same time it is equally important that managers and supervisors are made aware of the importance of fair processes and procedures in the allocation of career development opportunities and that they gain the necessary experience of facilitating and supporting the careers of their employees. such decision-making processes should uphold the principles of procedural justice by being transparent consistent allowing employee input and influence suppressing bias and being based on accurate and relevant information. employees should also be provided with regular communications regarding their career development and bven quality and timely feedback on any career-related decisions affecting them. \n",
