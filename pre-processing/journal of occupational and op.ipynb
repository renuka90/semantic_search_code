naturalistic decision-making (ndm) can be usefully applied\\n\\nto study ‘decision inertia’ – namely the cognitive process associated with failures to\\nexecute action when a decision-maker struggles to choose between equally perceived\\n\\naversive outcomes. data assessed the response and recovery from a sudden impact\\n\\ndisaster during a 2-day immersive simulated emergency response. fourteen agencies\\n\\n(including police, fire, ambulance, and military) and 194 participants were involved in the\\n\\nexercise. by assessing the frequency, type, audience, and content of communications, and\\n\\nby reference to five subject matter experts’ slow time analyses of critical turning points\\n\\nduring the incident, three barriers were identified as reducing multiagency information\\n\\nsharing and the macrocognitive understanding of the incident. when the decision\\n\\nproblem was non-time-bounded, involved multiple agencies, and identification of\\n\\nsuperordinate goals was lacking, the communication between agencies decreased and\\n\\nagencies focused on within-agency information sharing. these barriers distracted teams\\n\\nfrom timely and efficient discussions on decisions and action execution with seeking\\n\\nredundant information, which resulted in decision inertia. our study illustrates how\\n\\nnaturalistic environments are conducive to examining relatively understudied concepts of\\n\\ndecision inertia, failures to act, and shared situational macrocognition in situations\\n\\ninvolving large distributed teams.\\n\\npractitioner points\\n\\n� researchers can use ndm to explore the cognitive processing associated with failures to act/decision\\ninertia.\\n\\n� complexities in the decision-making environment of a multiteam system (e.g., non-time-bounded\\nchoice, large team size, and lack of strategic goals) are associated with decision-making failures.\\n\\n� barriers cause decision inertia as teams focus on redundant intra-agency information seeking rather\\nthan cooperative interagency communications.\\n\\n� strategic direction is especially important for shifting multiteam system communication towards\\ninteragency discussions on action execution.\\n\\nif the behavioural implementation of making a decision is the execution of action\\n\\n(lipshitz, klein, orasanu, & salas, 2001; yates, 2003), then failing tomake a decision (e.g.,\\n\\nmaking an executive choice) is when action execution fails. traditional decision-making\\n\\n*correspondence should be addressed to laurence alison,

l.j.alison@liverpool.ac.uk).\\n\\ndoi:10.1111/joop.12108\\n\\n295\\n\\n\\n\\nresearch has helped psychologists to understand the conditions under which decisions\\n\\nare likely to be actioned in a static, closed environment, where decision-makers have the\\n\\nopportunity to analyse the choice context and select an optimal course of action (e.g.,\\n\\nexpected utility theory; von neumann & morgenstern, 1947). yet in the ‘real world’,\\ndecision-makers rarely have the luxury of having unambiguous information or sufficient\\n\\ntime to analyse choices, and thus, their rationality is bound by cognitive constraints\\n\\n(simon, 1956).whilst early research treated bounded rationality asmaladaptive in causing\\n\\ncognitive biases and faulty heuristic processing (kahneman&tversky, 1979), ‘naturalistic\\n\\ndecision-making’ (ndm) takes a more pragmatic perspective.\\n\\nthe ndm paradigm\\nndm rejects the notion of ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ decisions and instead seeks to understand the\\n\\ncognitive processes associatedwith choice implementation by studying decision-making\\n\\n‘in thewild’ (gore, banks, millward, &kyraikidou, 2006;mcandrew&gore, 2013). ndm\\n\\nemphasizes the importance of real-world contexts, domain-specific expertise, and\\n\\nmacrocognition in distributed and sociotechnical teams (stanton,wong,gore, sevdalis, &\\n\\nstrub, 2011). the aim of ndm is ‘to understand how people make decisions in real-world\\n\\ncontexts that are meaningful and familiar to them’ (lipshitz et al., 2001, p. 332). it\\n\\njuxtaposes earlier decision-making research that aimed to explore decision-making errors\\n(kahneman & tversky, 1979) and instead takes a positive approach by focusing on the\\n\\nprocesses that enable individuals to make decisions (gore et al., 2006). this is why ndm\\n\\nresearch is often grounded in the notion of ‘expertise’ as researchers seek to uncover the\\n\\ndeclarative knowledge that is implicitly stored in the cognition of experts (klein, 1997).\\n\\nexpert ‘macrocognition’ goes beyond behavioural decision-making and encompasses a\\n\\nnumber of key cognitive elements that distinguish the expert from the novice, which\\n\\ninclude mental models, perceptual skills, sense of typicality, routines, and declarative\\n\\nknowledge (klein & militello, 2004).\\nin addition to furthering interest in positivist research, ndm has also developed\\n\\nnaturalistic methods for data collection. for example, ‘cognitive task analysis’ is uniquely\\n\\ndesigned to unpack macrocognition and includes various, and largely qualitative,\\n\\ntechniques such as the ‘critical decision method’ interview protocol (for more detail, see\\n\\ncrandall, klein, & hoffman, 2006). an overreliance on ecologically invalid laboratory-\\n\\nbased settings is inappropriate (schneider & shanteau, 2003) as the real world is\\n\\ncharacterized by ill-structured problems, uncertainty, poorly defined goals, multiple\\n\\nfeedback loops, time constraints, high stakes, multiple players, and conflict between\\npersonal ideals and contextual requirements (orasanu&connolly, 1993). thus, this is the\\n\\nsetting in which research should be conducted. lipshitz (1993) recognized that although\\n\\nno unified ndm theory exists, they all have a common set of assumptions: cognitive\\n\\nprocessing in the real world varies, situation assessment is critical, mental imagery is\\n\\nimportant, the decision-making context must be specified, decision-making is dynamic,\\n\\nand research should focus on how decision-makers actually function rather than how\\n\\nthey ought to function.\\n\\nan unparalleled advantage of ndm is the active encouragement for researchers to\\nremain flexible and open minded when exploring large and naturalistic data sets. this\\n\\nfacilitates the discovery of novel or previously missed psychological phenomena through\\n\\ncoincidental observations. for example, the notion of expertise and ‘recognition-primed\\n\\ndecision-making’ was a product of ndm research (klein, 1997). a series of cognitive\\n\\ninterviews conductedwith expert firefighters revealed how skilled decision-makers were\\n\\n296 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nable to rapidly select a course of action by ‘pattern matching’ between the environment\\n\\nand the available responses they had cognitively stored. crucially, klein (2008) found that\\n\\nexperts tend not to compare options to find the best response but instead evaluate each\\n\\noption in singular succession until they find one that is good enough. these conclusions\\non expert cognition have since been replicated in a wide range of domains and have had a\\n\\nsignificant impact on the understanding of expertise. for example, jenkins, stanton,\\n\\nsalmon, walker, and rafferty (2010) found that experts will ‘leap’ or ‘shunt’ between\\n\\ndecision stages to facilitate rapid and intuitive action, whereas novice decision-makers are\\n\\nmore analytical and linear in their decision-making. experts are also able to ‘reflect in\\n\\naction’ during the decision-making process to reduce situation uncertainty and ensure\\n\\nthat their actions remain consistent with the changing environment (cristancho,\\n\\nvanstone, lingard, lebel, & ott, 2013; sch€on, 1987; van den heuvel, alison, & power,\\n2014).\\n\\ntaking the above into account, the topic of interest for the current study was also a\\n\\nproduct of naturalistic observations. the authors, after having used ndm to research\\n\\ncritical incident decision-making in the domain of emergency service workers for over\\n\\n15 years, noticed that when faced with a challenging decision, even experienced\\n\\ndecision-makers often fail to take any action at all. in other words, they appeared to rely\\n\\non a cognitive heuristic that suggests when the solution to a problem is unclear, the\\n\\nsafest option is to do nothing. rather than commit to a choice, they actively (and with\\nconsiderable cognitive effort) try and delay the implementation of a choice (eyre,\\n\\nalison, crego, & mclean, 2008; van den heuvel, alison, & crego, 2012). this is distinct\\n\\nfrom decision avoidance (anderson, 2003) where decision-makers refuse to evaluate\\n\\nchoice through passive inaction (e.g., ‘i choose not to decide for the time being’).\\n\\ninstead, we have observed how decision-makers fail to act through ‘decision inertia’, the\\n\\ncognitively active and redundant deliberation of choice despite there being a low (or\\n\\nno) chance of discovering any new information to inform the decision (e.g., ‘i am still\\n\\nthinking about whether i will commit to, refuse or avoid this choice’). this is important\\nin dynamic crisis environments where often the ‘most-worst’ outcome is the failure to\\n\\nact as ‘more is missed by not doing than not knowing’ (byrnes, 2011, p. 28). if a decision\\n\\nis optimal, then the team can perform well; if the decision is non-optimal, then the team\\n\\ncan re-evaluate, revise, and respond, yet if the decision is not made, then the team drifts\\n\\nalong a trajectory of uncertainty, inaction, and inertia. not only will this study provide\\n\\nan in-depth analysis of this novel approach to failures to act, but we will also highlight\\n\\nhow engagement with the ndm paradigm provided a contextualized, meaningful, and\\n\\napplicable methodology to research and discover the cognitive processes associated\\nwith inaction.\\n\\nusing ndm to research macrocognition in a multiagency emergency team responding\\n\\nto a simulated sudden impact major disaster\\n\\nemergency service workers must operate in highly dynamic, uncertain, and complex\\n\\ndecision-making environments where interoperable team coordination is essential to\\n\\nfacilitate action (house, power,&alison, 2014). these decision-making environments are\\nhighly unstable, rapid-changing, and unpredictable (van den heuvel et al., 2014), and\\n\\nthus, effective team processing requires that ‘members’ interdependent acts convert\\n\\ninputs to outcomes through cognitive, verbal, and behavioural activities directed towards\\n\\norganizing task work to achieve collective goals’ (marks, mathieu, & zaccaro, 2001, p.\\n\\n357). to clarify, macrocognition is the study of ‘how teamsmove between internalisation\\n\\ndecision inertia 297\\n\\n\\n\\nand externalisation of cognition to build knowledge in service of problem solving’ (fiore\\n\\net al., 2010, p. 203). it considers both social and technical influences on team cognition\\n\\nduring the decision process (schubert, denmark, crandall, grome, & pappas, 2012) to\\n\\nincrease understanding of collective group cognition during sensemaking (stanton et al.,\\n2011). teams are not only made up of a collection of individuals, but also consist of\\n\\n‘subteams’ (or ‘agencies’). in multiteam systems, individuals will share and utilize\\n\\ninformation to assist both individual (intra-agency) decision-making goals and more\\n\\nstrategic joint (interagency) decisions and actions (ancona &chong, 1996). they need to\\n\\nshift attention between within-group, intrateam processing, and between-group,\\n\\ninterteam coordination (marks et al., 2001). for example, police officers operate with\\n\\ntheir ‘intra-agency’ police colleagues along with their ‘interagency’ emergency response\\n\\ncolleagues (e.g., fire and ambulance services), who have both cohesive and conflicting\\ngoals depending on the incident and required outcome.\\n\\nteams struggle to make decisions due to poor communication, inconsistent situation\\n\\nawareness, and conflict of interests (chen, sharman, rao, & upadhyaya, 2008). rusman,\\n\\nvan bruggen, sloep, and koper (2010) examined virtually distributed teams and found\\n\\nthat ‘trust’ between team members was based upon judgements of communality, ability,\\n\\nbenevolence, internalized norms, and accountability. not only does this show the\\n\\nimportance of placing objective trust in another’s ability during teamwork (mayer, davis,\\n\\n& schoorman, 1995), but it also highlights the importance of subjective ratings of\\nbenevolence, norms, and communality thatwill be derived frompast experiencewith one\\n\\nanother. keyton and beck (2010) highlighted how the type and meaning of communi-\\n\\ncations in teams is based upon an ever-evolving context derived from past interactions\\n\\nwithin the team. past experiences of operating within a specific team influences an\\n\\nindividual’s understanding of their role and team culture (bearman, paletz, orasanu, &\\n\\nthomas, 2010)which can influence their decision-making behaviour at both an individual\\n\\nand collective levels (marks et al., 2001). thus, research needs to be sensitive to social\\n\\ndynamics and embrace subjective and personal experiences. ndm methods are ideal for\\nenabling a deeper exploration of both intra- and intergroup processing at both cognitive\\n\\nand socially constructed levels.\\n\\nexploring how time pressure, team size, and strategic direction interact with\\n\\ndecision-making in emergency service decision-making teams\\n\\nemergency incident contexts provide a unique domain in which to apply ndm to study\\n\\nmultiteam systems, cognitive processing, and failures to act. over the last decade, a\\nconsiderable number of natural and man-made major emergencies have occurred, which\\n\\ninclude flooding, tsunamis, nuclear accidents, and toxic chemical spills. the effects of\\n\\nthese emergency incidents are widespread, affecting a large population, disrupting\\n\\ninfrastructure, and incurring huge costs (emotional, physical, and commercial) in both the\\n\\nshort and long term. although society recovers, post-incident criticisms of such major\\n\\ndisasters often suggest that there was inadequate pre-planning and delayed responding.\\n\\nfor example, japan’s nuclear accident independent investigation commission empha-\\n\\nsized howdelays in taking action contributed to the inappropriate response that occurred\\nduring the fukushima nuclear disaster, which lead to confusing and conflicting messages\\n\\nat both a response and civilian level (kurokawa, 2012). as a result, the magnitude of the\\n\\ninitial damagewas greater, and the amount of time taken to recover was longer, due to the\\n\\ninherent ambiguity and complexity associated with the challenging environment (van\\n\\nden heuvel et al., 2014).\\n\\n298 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nwe selected three barriers that, with reference to the literature and anecdotal\\n\\nevidence, were anticipated to reduce action implementation and instead cause time-\\n\\ndelayed inertia decision-making processes. we predicted that interagency communica-\\n\\ntions would decrease when choices were non-time-bounded, involved multiple agencies,\\nand lacked clear strategic direction. these ‘barriers’ were relevant to the decision-making\\n\\ncontext of emergency incidents as they typically involve multiteam systems who often\\n\\nhold competing goals and must operate under variable time pressures. although it is\\n\\nrecognized that conductingndmresearch at simulated training events offers thepotential\\n\\nto explore a vast array of other variables (e.g., expertise, decision strategies, behavioural\\n\\npatterns), we chose to focus on three specific barriers in order to reduce and control the\\n\\ndata set, and to aid our understanding of the cognitive and social processes associatedwith\\n\\nfailures to act.\\n\\ntime-bounded choice\\n\\na choice can be either time pressured to meet a deadline or non-time-bounded and thus\\n\\namenable to deliberation. when an individual is exposed to time-pressured deadlines,\\n\\nthey will try and adapt to time constraints by reducing their generation of potential\\n\\noptions (alison, doran, long, power, & humphrey, 2013). time pressure makes\\n\\nindividuals more risk-seeking and increases the likelihood of choice implementation\\n(young, goodie, hall, & wu, 2012), but this does not always lead to increased decision\\n\\naccuracy. ndm research has described how skilled decision-makers can adapt well to\\n\\ntime pressure using efficient and intuitive pattern matching (alison, van den heuvel\\n\\net al., 2013; klein, 1997), whereas less skilled decision-makers will utilize faulty and\\n\\nbiased cognitive and heuristic shortcuts to speed up and bypass the decision-making\\n\\nprocess (ask & granhag, 2007). yet there has been relatively little research on how the\\n\\nabsence of time pressure influences choice, specifically with regard to how it\\n\\ninfluences the likelihood and timeliness of action execution. this may be due to the\\ntraditional use of experimental paradigms whereby choices are made salient to the\\n\\ndecision-maker in order to prompt a response, thereby artificially inducing a pressure to\\n\\nrespond.\\n\\nwhen a decision is not constrained to deadlines, this means that decision-makers have\\n\\nthe opportunity to avoid or redundantly deliberate on their choice. when decisions are\\n\\nperceived to be difficult, then individuals will try to avoid committing to a course of action\\n\\n(van denheuvel et al., 2012) in order to avoid anticipated negative consequences such as\\n\\nnegative emotions (anderson, 2003), and when operating within organizational settings,\\nthe potential for criticism is due to accountability (waring, alison, cunningham, &\\n\\nwhitfield, 2013). when someone expects to receive feedback on their actions in team-\\n\\nbased settings, they will tend to avoid choice (zeelenberg & van dijk, 1997) due to the\\n\\npotential for anticipated loss (crotty & thompson, 2009), the anticipation of blame (eyre\\n\\net al., 2008), or the perceived inability to personally justify their choice (brooks, 2011). a\\n\\nlack of deadlines means that individuals aremore likely to use deliberative and alternative-\\n\\nbased processing of choice to establish whether any of their available options are\\n\\navailable/acceptable (parker & schrift, 2011), in place of more time-efficient cognitive\\nsearch strategies, such as satisficing (simon, 1956), which establishes which of the\\n\\navailable options is the ‘least worst’ or ‘acceptable’. thus, a complex decision problem\\n\\nthat is ‘non-time-bounded’ has high potential for inertia, and we predicted that this will\\n\\nprincipally manifest through reduced action execution and increased redundant\\n\\ndeliberation over already established intra-agency information.\\n\\ndecision inertia 299\\n\\n\\n\\nteam size\\n\\ncommunication and coordination are essential for facilitating a team’s macrocognitive\\n\\nfunctioning (keyton & beck, 2010). we hypothesized that as the number of responding\\n\\nagencies involved in the decision task increased, the ability to coordinate action would\\ndiminish. this is because although ‘interdependent’ tasks require the coordination of\\n\\ninformation and resources frommultiple players (van de ven, delbecq, & koenig, 1976),\\n\\nthe increase in the number of people involved makes the decision environment more\\n\\ncomplex (lepine, piccolo, jackson, mathieu, & saul, 2008). team decision-making is\\n\\nfacilitated by shared mental models, where all players hold a common understanding of\\n\\nthe situation and associated actions (mathieu, marks, & zaccaro, 2001). the key\\n\\nmacrocognitive function of a multiteam system is to reduce uncertainty and risk by\\n\\nestablishing andmaintaining common ground and sharedmental models (schubert et al.,\\n2012). in multiteam systems, shared mental models not only inform how players should\\n\\ncoordinate within their own team but also help a collective awareness of interagency\\n\\ngoals and actions (mathieu et al., 2001). multiteam systems must monitor both inter- and\\n\\nintrateam processes to provide relevant feedback and instruction to one another\\n\\n(dickinson & mcintyre, 1997). team monitoring and coordination behaviours that help\\n\\nfacilitate action should occur continually to ensure that actions within the multiagency\\n\\nnetwork are consistent (brannick, prince, prince, & salas, 1992; marks et al., 2001).\\n\\nestablishing a sharedmentalmodel ismore difficult in large teams. being amember of a\\nlarge team reduces an individual’s psychological ‘ownership’ of a problem as responsi-\\n\\nbility is diffused throughout the wider team network (kroon, ’t hart, & van kreveld,\\n\\n1991). an individual’s sense of ownership of a problem influences how personally\\n\\nresponsible they feel for the potential consequences of a choice (pierce, kostova, &dirks,\\n\\n2001). holding someone individually accountable for collective outcomes makes them\\n\\nwork harder at a team level (kroon et al., 1991), and thus, psychological ownership\\n\\nfacilitates team work. in large teams, individuals have less ‘ownership’, feel less\\n\\naccountable, and thus reduce their efforts as lines of communication become exponen-\\ntially larger rather than additive (kroon et al., 1991). when support from other team\\n\\nmembers is lacking, individuals are less likely to process decision tasks at an individual\\n\\nlevel (mueller, 2012). in addition, when operating in hierarchical teams involving\\n\\ncommand structures (such as the emergency services), these process losses associated\\n\\nwith increased team size are often underestimated by those in charge (staats, milkman, &\\n\\nfox, 2012). this could induce erroneous expectations of decision-making capabilities\\n\\nfrom those higher up the decision-making command chain. therefore, we hypothesized\\n\\nthat as team size increased, the likelihood of action would reduce due to associated\\nreductions in psychological ownership of the decision problem, feelings of responsibility,\\n\\nand diluted communications.\\n\\nsuperordinate goals\\n\\n‘superordinate (strategic) goals’ help guide decision-makers to generate and evaluate\\n\\ndifferent courses of action (cannon-bowers, tannenbaum, salas, & volpe, 1995;\\n\\ndickinson & mcintyre, 1997). they are ‘goals that are urgent and compelling for all\\ngroups involved butwhose attainment requires the resources and efforts ofmore than one\\n\\ngroup’ (sherif, 1962, p. 19). strategic direction helps to guide the planning of actions to\\n\\nachieve goals. it can facilitate deliberate planning, wherein principal courses of action for\\n\\nmission accomplishment are formulated, contingency planning, where alternative plans\\n\\nare developed to adapt to any anticipated potential events, and reactive planningwhich is\\n\\n300 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nin response to unanticipated changes during the incident (cannon-bowers et al., 1995;\\n\\nmarks et al., 2001). in multiteam systems, common goals are critical for interteam\\n\\ncooperation as it transforms individual units into a powerful collective (katzenbach &\\n\\nsmith, 1993). individuals often hold competing individual and team-based goals that can\\nmake decision-making difficult (wittenbaum, hollingshead, & botero, 2004). clear\\n\\nstrategic direction can reduce cognitive conflict by placing boundaries on decision-\\n\\nmaking and making collective aims salient. the setting of superordinate goals can also\\n\\nhelp teams to adopt a collective identity,which can reduce the potential for diluted efforts\\n\\nas a product of large teams and facilitate intergroup cooperation (driskell, salas, &\\n\\njohnston, 1999).\\n\\nto establish and reach common strategic goals, a team must exchange reciprocal\\n\\ninformation across the network. individuals need to understand the network as a\\nwhole in terms of available resources and expertise, and also be made aware of any\\n\\npotential constraints in the decision environment (stout, cannon-bowers, salas, &\\n\\nmilanovich, 1999). effective macrocognition in teams is thus dependent upon ‘action\\n\\nprocesses’, the acts taken by members that contribute directly to goal accomplishment\\n\\n(marks et al., 2001) and help synchronize both individual and collective activities\\n\\nwithin complex, dynamic, and unpredictable environments (tesluk, mathieu, zaccaro,\\n\\n& marks, 1997). action processes help with sense making across the team network\\n\\n(alberts & hayes, 2006) as they involve team monitoring and the implementation of\\nsynchronized and coordinated actions (marks et al., 2001). in addition, the commu-\\n\\nnication of strategic direction must be communicated with explicit meaning and intent\\n\\nacross the multiteam network to achieve a shared awareness (beck & keyton, 2009;\\n\\nkeyton & beck, 2010). taking the above into account, we predicted that a lack of clear\\n\\nstrategic direction would reduce the ability to coordinate and communicate decisions\\n\\nand actions.\\n\\nmethod\\n\\ndata were collected from a large-scale multiagency (n = 14 agencies) simulation-based\\ntraining exercise of an aeroplane crash over a major city. it explored the macrocognitive\\n\\nprocessing of a multiagency, emergency response team who would be expected to\\n\\nrespond to this type of incident. the training event was conducted using the ‘hydra’\\n\\nsystem, an immersive simulated learning platform that can assist organizational training\\nwhilst facilitating research. as discussed at length by alison, van denheuvel et al. (2013),\\n\\nsimulations provide a useful platform for studying decision-making in multiteam systems\\n\\n(such as the emergency services) as they provide vast amounts of varied data to explore\\n\\nthe social, organizational, cultural, and political factors that are inherent in such\\n\\norganizational environments, whilst importantly facilitating their primary purpose in\\n\\ntraining decision-makers by exposing them to challenging incidents. hydra replicates a\\n\\ntraditional ‘tabletop’ simulation exercise by placing trainees (or participants) into small\\n\\nteams split across separate ‘syndicate rooms’. those who are running the exercise, in our\\ncase amixture of trainers and researchers, control the simulation from the central ‘control\\n\\nroom’ by feeding relevant information into each syndicate room. as with a traditional\\n\\ntabletop exercise, participants are split into teams and placed into syndicate rooms\\n\\naccording to thepurpose of the simulation. each syndicate room is equippedwith a laptop\\n\\ncomputer, a large tv screen to project the computer image, a printer, and a video/sound\\n\\nrecorder.\\n\\ndecision inertia 301\\n\\n\\n\\nduring the exercise, syndicate rooms are fed information. information feeds or\\n\\n‘injects’ may include videos, audio clips, paper print out messages, or even role players.\\n\\nsyndicate rooms can also request and receive additional information through the\\n\\n‘communicator’, a chat box that links each syndicate room to the central control room.\\nfacilitators in the control room can respond to information requests from each syndicate\\n\\nroom through this system,monitor decision logs, andpass information between syndicate\\n\\nrooms at the request of participants. this allows simulations to be fluid, dynamic, and\\n\\nresponsive to the actions of the participants in the syndicate rooms, enabling an in-depth\\n\\nanalysis of immersive and ndm whilst maintaining a level of experimental control.\\n\\nparticipants\\nparticipants (n = 194) took part in a two-day simulated exercise of an aeroplane crash\\nover a major city. participants came from 14 different agencies, including the police\\n\\n(n = 20), fire (n = 10), ambulance (n = 8), military (n = 3), local authority (n = 12),\\ngovernment offices (n = 15), media (n = 19), health services (n = 15), environment\\nagency (n = 6), utilities (n = 6), science and technical advice (n = 13), and transport\\n(n = 31), along with a multiagency gold group (n = 36). all participants were\\nexperienced real-life responders who could be required to respond to a real-life major\\n\\nincident of this nature (london emergency services liaison panel, 2007). they were a\\nmixture of strategic (‘gold’) decision-makers (whowere placed in one syndicate room and\\n\\nwere tasked with making strategic decisions about the incident) and tactical decision-\\n\\nmakers from each agency (who were split into separate syndicate rooms during the\\n\\nexercise, one for each agency team).\\n\\nin addition to the participants in the syndicate rooms, 10 trainers and 19 subjectmatter\\n\\nadvisors were located in the control room. advisors were experienced emergency\\n\\nresponders from the local resilience forumwho helped design the scenario andwere able\\n\\nto respond to agency-specific information requests. the exercise control team was\\nresponsible for feeding information feeds to each syndicate room and responding to\\n\\ncommunicator messages.\\n\\nprocedure\\n\\nstrategic ‘gold’ commanders from each agencywere placed into one syndicate room, and\\n\\nsupporting staff from each agency were split into separate agency-specific ‘syndicate\\n\\nrooms’ (figure 1). this set-up was designed to replicate the command structure that\\nwould be in operation during a real-life major incident in the united kingdom. each\\n\\nsyndicate room received information that reflected what they would receive in a real-life\\n\\nevent. for example, support staff in the ambulance syndicate room received information\\n\\nregarding casualties, whereas the police support staff received information on cordoning\\n\\nand evacuation procedures. agencies communicated to one another by sending logged\\n\\nmessages through the communicator (via the control room). they were also able to\\n\\ncommunicate with other members of their own agency not in the syndicate room (e.g.,\\n\\nthose from their agency on the simulated incident ground) also via a message to the\\ncontrol room.\\n\\nthe training event took place over 2 days. day one of the training event simulated the\\n\\nmultiagency ‘response’ phase, which ran in real time from 8 am until 10 pm and\\n\\nrepresented two simulated days (e.g., ‘day 1 response’ and ‘day 2 response’). the second\\n\\nexercise day simulated themultiagency ‘recovery’ phase, which ran in real time from 8 am\\n\\n302 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nuntil 12 midday and simulated the transition to ‘day 3 recovery’ (london emergency\\n\\nservices liaison panel, 2007). during the simulation, participants within separate\\n\\nsyndicate rooms were responsible for sharing and coordinating the information they had\\nreceived to relevant internal and external bodies through the communicator.\\n\\nthe scenario: aeroplane collision over a major city\\n\\na general timeline was followed by the exercise control room. the control team fed\\n\\ninformation about the overall unfolding scenario to all agencies; however, specific\\n\\ntimelines and information feeds were adapted during the simulation based upon the\\n\\nlearning requirements of the exercise and recommendations from advisors. the initial\\ninformation feed (that went to all agencies) stated that two aeroplanes had crashed above\\n\\na local city airport: one crashed into a residential tower and the other crashed into apower\\n\\nstation (causing a large section of the city to lose power). subsequent feeds involved\\n\\nupdates on traffic congestion, the failure of specific metro lines, information on toxic\\n\\nplumes and reduced air quality over large and populated areas of the city, updates on\\n\\nnumber of victims and casualties involved, and information regarding hospital generators\\n\\nfailing and running out of fuel. agency-specific information feeds involved, for example,\\n\\nan intelligence update that terrorism could not be ruled out (police) and that the number\\nof available resources were being stretched due to the severity of the incident (fire and\\n\\nambulance).\\n\\ndata collection\\n\\ndatawere collated from the electronic communication logs thatwere passed between the\\n\\nsyndicates and control room. participants used communication logs to request additional\\n\\ninformation about the incident from their own or other responding agencies and also to\\nprovide information when requested. they used the communicator to coordinate\\n\\ndecisions and actions and request information from their own agency (e.g., advisors) or\\n\\nother agencies. participants marked their communications as follows: (1) information\\n\\nseeking, (2) a decision, or (3) an action. communications were coded according to\\n\\nfigure 1. a typical syndicate room used during a ‘hydra’ simulation.\\n\\ndecision inertia 303\\n\\n\\n\\nwhether theywere ‘intra-agency’ (e.g., fire requesting confirmation of available resources\\n\\nfrom control) or ‘interagency’ (e.g., police coordinating triage locationswith ambulance).\\n\\ncommunications were coded as intra- or interagency only when they explicitly\\n\\nmentioned either their own or another agency. note that ‘intra-agency’ communications\\ndoes not refer to verbal communications made within syndicate rooms, but relates to\\n\\nmessages concerning their agency that were sent to the control room.\\n\\ndata analysis\\n\\nsocial network analysis\\n\\nsocial network analysis (sna) usefully provides an overarching picture of the social\\n\\ndynamics of team-based settings and can further be used to focus qualitative analysis. we\\n\\nconducted a sna of the communication logs to produce an overview of the social\\n\\ninteraction and relationships between the different agencies involved in the exercise\\n\\n(knoke & yang, 2008). relational sna shows how central a group is within the network,\\nwhere they are positioned within the network (which is defined by their relationship or\\n\\nties to all others), and how dense the ties are between the groups or people that make up\\n\\nthat network (mizruchi, 1994).\\n\\nthe initial step in analysis involved inputting frequency data into the network analysis\\n\\npackage, ucinet (borgatti, everett, & freeman, 1992). to analyse the density,\\n\\ncentralization, and hierarchy of the social network, two communication matrices were\\n\\nproduced: one that reflected the presence or absence of communication between\\n\\nagencies, and another to indicate the total sum of messages between agencies (table 1).\\nthese matrices coded communications across the entire incident, as well as specifically\\n\\nwithin the ‘response’ (e.g., days 1 and 2) and ‘recovery’ (e.g., day 3) phases of the\\n\\nsimulation. in addition, a multidimensional-scale technique was used to create a visual\\n\\nrepresentation of networked communications for both the response and recovery phases\\n\\n(figures 2 and 3). this visual representation involves plotting all agencies relative to one\\n\\nanother so that their position within the space reflects how strongly they are socially\\n\\nconnected to others. agencies that are closely located havemore relative associationwith\\n\\neach other and represent the keymembers of that network, whilst agencies on the fringes\\nor periphery of the network are those agencies who communicated less with all others\\n\\n(heinz & manikas, 1992).\\n\\nidentifying the ‘critical issues’ that required interagency communication\\n\\none of the challenges of ndm research is establishing how to judge decision-making\\n\\nquality (gore et al., 2006). the sna provided top-level frequency findings on\\n\\ncommunications between agencies, but this does not provide us with information about\\ncommunication quality. for example, some decisions may require more internal than\\n\\nexternal collaboration and thus decentralized networks may counter-intuitively reflect\\n\\nbetter quality coordination. to address this, we approached five subject matter experts\\n\\n(smes; three high ranking police officers, one ex-military, and one chief fire officer) who\\n\\nhighlighted six ‘critical issues’ during this scenario that, according to their expertise and\\n\\nexperience, required a high frequency of interagency liaison (table 2). these smes were\\n\\nexternal to the exercise and were approached post-exercise (via email). they were\\n\\nprovided with a timeline and information feeds from the exercise in slow time and were\\nasked to identify the ‘critical issues’, where interagency communication was required for\\n\\n304 laurence alison et

their\\ncontent, f(2, 22) = 6.246, p = .007. significantly more messages discussed information\\nseeking (m = 55.58, sd = 35.82) than decisions (m = 30.00, sd = 22.68) or actions\\n(m = 16.17, sd = 28.229). there was a significant interaction between communication\\ncontent, audience, and frequency, f(1.23, 13.58) = 6.871, p = .016, as information-\\nseeking communications were especially intra-agency (figure 2).\\n\\nsocial network analysis\\nunicet was used to calculate ‘network density’ and how embedded or isolated each\\n\\n‘node’ (e.g., agency) was within the wider network (hanneman & riddle, 2005). the\\n\\naverage density value was 3.45, which represented an average density tie of 59.5%. this\\n\\nmeant that, across the entire incident, 59.5% of all possible reciprocal communications\\n\\nbetween agencies occurredwith an average number ofmessages between agency pairs of\\n\\n3.5 messages. this indicated that 40.5% of possible communications between agencies\\n\\nwere notmade. lowdensity occurred because agencies focused on contacting individuals\\n\\nwithin their own organizations instead of the network (table 1). the highest number of\\ninteragency communications (n = 16; transport and utilities) was less than a quarter of\\nthe number of intra-agency communications (n = 86; fire and rescue). network density\\nwas significantly higher during the response phase of the incident (density = 2.95)\\ncompared to the recovery phase (density = 0.49), t(0.61) = 2.61, p < .05, as 75.4% of all\\npossible communications were made during response compared to only 27.1% during\\n\\nrecovery (table 3). this pattern was also illustrated in the visual representations of the\\n\\nnetwork, as the response phase had more (strong) ties between pairs of agencies\\n\\n(figure 3) than the recovery phase (figure 4).\\ncentralizationmeasures howwell connected a node iswith the rest of the network. in-\\n\\ndegree centrality reflects the

each agency’s itemized centrality for both phases of\\nthe incident and across the entire incident. in addition, the sna found no evidence of a\\n\\nhierarchywithin the network at any phase of the incident or overall (table 4). thismeant\\n\\nthat no single agency commanded the incident as a key player (albeit this findingwould be\\n\\nexpected as a product of the uk gold command structure).\\n\\ninteroperability during six ‘critical issues’\\n\\ncritical issueswere coded for the presence or absence of our three hypothesized ‘barriers’\\nto multiagency decision-making, namely whether the issue was ongoing in duration (e.g.,\\n\\nlacked a deadline), involved three or more agencies, and/or lacked a clear superordinate\\n\\ngoal (e.g., lacked strategic direction fromgold; table 6). although therewas no significant\\n\\ncorrelation between the number of barriers present and the frequency of interagency\\n\\ncommunications, there was an interesting trend in the data. it was found that barrier\\n\\nfrequency was negatively correlated to interagency communication frequency\\n\\n(r = �.542, p = .266); as the number of barriers increased, communicationwith external\\nagencies decreased. likewise, a nonsignificant positive correlation was found between\\n\\nfigure 4. ma network during the recovery phase of incident management.\\n\\ntable 4. hierarchy and

were communications were predominantly intra-agency focussed\\n\\n(i.e., not intereoperable). both ‘resource coordination’ and ‘casualty triage’ critical issues\\n\\nhad ongoing duration (e.g., lacked a deadline for a final decision and action), involved\\n\\nmore than two agencies, and, following analysis of the communications sent from the\\n‘gold’ strategic syndicate, had no superordinate goals. the only reference made to\\n\\n‘resources’ in the gold syndicate was unclear: ‘police gold: scene management and\\n\\nresourcing at scene’, and communications on ‘casualty triage’ focused on information\\n\\nseeking rather than setting necessary direction: ‘fatalities.what is the scale of the incident\\n\\nwe are dealingwith?’; ‘bodies left on scene at present? those at hospital being dealt with’.\\n\\nthus, both issues were considered by the smes to lack strategic direction.\\n\\nanalyses of communication content at the tactical level supported our earlier finding\\n\\nthat

is\\n\\nambulance coping with core business? i.e. availability of resources?’; as did the fire and\\n\\nrescue service: ‘all bulk foamunits are currently in use.what reserve stocks of foamdowe\\nhave and do we need to order more?’ for the casualty triage issue, it was also found that\\n\\nagencies were primarily concerned with information about internal resources: ‘request\\n\\ninformation from icr regarding our casualty figures from all sites’. despite this, the smes\\n\\nrecommended that communication between agencies should be interagency focused to\\n\\nreach a successful resolution. as was found, an intra-agency focus on internal resources\\n\\nreduced the ability of agencies to coordinate resources on scene. likewise, agencies\\n\\ndiscussed casualty triage by gathering information from one another, yet failed to\\n\\ncoordinate their efforts on scene to facilitate action. both issueswere characterized by the\\nthree identified barriers, and both issues induced a failure to communicate between\\n\\nagencies and execute action.\\n\\nqualitative analyses of critical issues characterized by interagency communication: communication\\n\\nchannel failure, reception centre location, emergency evacuation, and primacy handover\\n\\ndiscussions about the ‘communication channel failure’, ‘reception centre location’,\\n\\n‘emergency evacuation’, and ‘primacy handover’ were predominantly interagency (i.e.,\\n>50% of communications were interagency) and tended to focus less on information\\nseeking and more on action execution (figure 5). the only exception was the\\n\\n‘communication channel failure’ issue (table 6), as this issue was minimally discussed\\n\\n(n = 8) and only just reached the 50% interagency communicationmargin. in terms of the\\nbarriers that were present for these issues, there were mixed findings. as mentioned, the\\n\\nfrequency of interagency communications was negatively, albeit non-significantly,\\n\\nassociated with the number of barriers. it is likely that this non-significant trend was in\\n\\npart due to the mixed findings when the number of barriers dropped below 3.\\nboth team size and duration of issue are barriers to interoperability that are difficult to\\n\\ninfluence from a solutions perspective. as such, we focused on the setting

al.\\n\\n\\n\\nsuperordinate goals from ‘gold’ decision-makers for our analysis. although gold\\n\\nacknowledged communication channel failures as an issue that needed to be resolved:\\n\\n‘mobile phone network may not be working. not sure how to communicate to\\n\\ncommunity’, they did not outline a strategic goal. likewise, the emergency evacuation\\nissue lacked clear strategic direction as commanders focused on information seeking over\\n\\nsetting goals: ‘need to have update re smoke/direction and intensity etc’. this lack of\\n\\nsuperordinate strategy further impacted tactical discussions as responders focused on\\n\\nreacting to the impact of the issue rather than generating tactics for resolution or to\\n\\nprevent further escalation or harm: ‘boroughs need to be mindful of the lack of\\n\\ncommunication methods due to the loss of power’; ‘contact aaib for specialist advice\\n\\nregarding hazards contained within smoke plume’. thus, although there was a high\\n\\nproportion of interagency communication, they did not induce action. as indicated in\\nfigure 5, the content of communications for these two issues was fairly evenly dispersed\\n\\nbetween information seeking, decision-making, and action execution. although they\\n\\nwere not dominated by information seeking as was found for the two intra-agency issues,\\n\\nthe proportion of communications was less focused on action execution than their\\n\\ninteragency counterpart issues (e.g., reception centre location, primacy handover).\\n\\nfundamentally, a lack of strategic direction diluted the focus of discussions on action\\n\\nexecution.\\n\\nin contrast, the ‘reception centre location’ and ‘primacy handover’ issues did have\\nclear strategic direction. for the reception centre location issue, gold communicated a\\n\\nclear goal: ‘agree to active humanitarian centre’ and further specified who should take\\n\\ncharge: ‘la [local authority] to organise humanitarian centre’. this meant that the local\\n\\nauthoritywas able to take charge of the tactical response and coordinate actionwith other\\n\\nagencies: ‘la understands police have been posed question about flowers and other\\n\\ntributes and are identifying suitable areas. expect contact soon on this’. this was similar\\n\\nfor the primacy handover issue: ‘la have the lead. key messages, major tragedy. all\\n\\nagencies have worked together; now return to normality’. interestingly, although this\\nmessage was not communicated until the very end of the response phase of the incident,\\n\\nthe la (in accordance with their role) had already begun contingency planning for taking\\n\\nprimacy: ‘recovery group meeting convened at 13.00. rationale: to initiate process and\\n\\nan impact assessment in the early stages and to horizon scan for the next 48 hours’.\\n\\ncommunications predominantly focused on action execution rather than redundant\\n\\ninformation seeking (figure 5). thus, issues that were guided by strategy from gold were\\n\\ndealt with through increased interagency communications (as recommended by the\\n\\nsmes) that specifically focused on the useful execution of actions.\\n\\ndiscussion\\n\\nndm can be used in a novel way to explore the intricate cognitive and social processes to\\n\\nunderstand failures to act. data were collected from an immersive simulated training\\n\\nexercise of the emergency response to a major disaster. the network as a whole was\\ndecentralized and communications tended to be intra-agency-focused and dominated by\\n\\ninformation seeking. smes identified six critical issues that required interagency\\n\\ncommunication for a successful resolution (e.g., decisions needed to be coordinated\\n\\njointly between agencies). if critical issues were non-time-bounded, involved more than\\n\\ntwo agencies, and lacked clear strategic direction, then communications predominantly\\n\\ninvolved redundant intra-agency information seeking, as opposed to the useful\\n\\ndecision inertia 313\\n\\n\\n\\ninteragency coordination of decisions and actions (as recommended by the smes). the\\n\\ndecision-making processwas delayeddue to decision inertia. however,whenone ormore\\n\\nof these barriers was missing, interagency communications increased and discussions\\n\\nwere more focused on decisions and actions. specifically, when issues had clear strategic\\ndirection, they were associated with action execution. we argue that the relatively under\\n\\nexplored notion of ‘decision inertia’ and the contexts that provoke it warrant further\\n\\nattention, as it is a salient problem in real-world decision-making. given the repeated\\n\\ncriticism of the emergency services for failures to act rather than for errors of judgment,\\n\\nwe suggest that specific attention be directed at this interesting phenomenon of what\\n\\nanderson (2003) more broadly describes as ‘the psychology of doing nothing’.\\n\\nlimitations\\n\\nit is difficult to dispute the academic integrity of the ndm movement in extending our\\n\\nunderstanding of real-world choice, yet there is an inherent methodological problem in\\n\\nderiving conclusions from such uncontrolled, complex, and dynamic contexts. by\\n\\nresearching ‘natural’ environments where the researcher cannot manipulate rigorously\\n\\ndefined independent variables, nor quantify objective dependent outcomes, the\\n\\nobjectivity of research conclusions is reduced. there is a risk that researchers’ interests\\n\\ncould bias the interpretation of the data, creating the potential for unreliable or invalid\\nfindings (lipshitz et al., 2001; mcandrew & gore, 2013), as researchers continually\\n\\nreturn to and attempt to explain the data, thereby risking post-hoc rationalization and\\n\\nassumed significance. likewise, it is possible that the ability to immerse oneself in the data,\\n\\nwith the freedom for methodological flexibility, is a strength for ndm research that\\n\\nprimarily desires pragmatic solutions derived from the data to help practitioners.\\n\\nit has been suggested that a useful way to improve objectivity may be through the\\n\\nuse of simulations, whereby researchers can maintain a level of control over the scenario\\n\\nand data recordings (alison, van den heuvel et al., 2013). yet this may come at the cost\\nof reduced stress and cognitive demand on the decision-maker compared to real life. the\\n\\nbehaviour of participants may also be influenced by the simulated environment as, for\\n\\nexample, participants focus more on information seeking over action implementation as\\n\\nthis is perceived as the main purpose of the communicator. alternatively, the traditional\\n\\nlaboratory-based decision-making environments may improve objectivity of conclusions,\\n\\nbut this comes at the cost of artificially clean decision-making environments that assume\\n\\npure rationality of thought (thwaites & williams, 2006). it is noteworthy that research\\n\\non emergency decision-making is notoriously complex and might involve many\\nvariables, such as strategic group-level presentation (van leeuwen, 2007), intricate\\n\\npower relations (nadler & halabi, 2006), perceived dangerousness of emergencies\\n\\n(fischer et al., 2011), and a whole spectrum of non-verbal factors, such as the body\\n\\nlanguage and facial expression of decision-makers, and a number of serious ethical\\n\\nconsiderations would also arise (binik, mah, & kiesler, 1999). furthermore, we should\\n\\nbear in mind that even the currently available virtual reality systems offer only crude\\n\\napproximations of natural experiences and only half-credible computer-generated\\n\\nresponses (rovira, swapp, spanlang, & slater, 2009). to deal with (but not to\\ncompletely overcome) this challenge, we adopted a complementary qualitative method\\n\\nthat could bring other kinds of subtle insights, which are sometimes out of scope for\\n\\nexperimental methods (bryman, 2007), to light.\\n\\nthus, we suggest that rather than judge research according to how ecologically ‘valid’\\n\\nor ‘objective’ it is, it should be judged according to the ‘credibility’ and ‘transferability’ of\\n\\n314 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nthe conclusions drawn from the context-rich environment (mischler, 1990). kuhn (1962)\\n\\nhighlights how the definition of ‘science’ is a culturally defined phenomenon according to\\n\\nthe benchmarks set by the scientists of the day; thus, ndm may reflect a paradigm shift\\n\\nfrom a top-down experimental focus to a more bottom-up focus on contextualized\\nenquiry. overall, although we acknowledge that there are methodological concerns for\\n\\nndm and simulation-based research, we argue that the unique advantage of context and\\n\\ngrounded meaning to conclusions is an unparalleled advantage of this research domain.\\n\\nthree barriers to macrocognition in multiteam systems: non-time-bounded choice,\\n\\nlarge team size, and a lack of superordinate direction\\n\\nwe found that when a decision task was non-time-bounded, involved multiple agencies,\\nand lacked clear strategic direction, then interagency action execution failed and decision\\n\\ninertia occurred through the redundant deliberation of intra-agency information.\\n\\ninterestingly, the only two issues where the majority of communications were intra-\\n\\nagency and focused on information seeking were also the only two issues that were\\n\\ncharacterized by all three decision barriers. it is acknowledged that whilst intra-agency\\n\\nresource monitoring is useful during a major incident response (national police\\n\\nimprovement agency, 2009), interagency coordination and information sharing is\\n\\nequally critical, and further that communications on decisions and actions will inevitably\\nbe less than those on information seeking; as the latter informs the former. to minimize\\n\\nthese effects, we focussed on the six ‘critical issues’ that smes identified as requiring\\n\\ninteragency communication.\\n\\nthe effectiveness of a multiteam system is dependent upon the sharing of task\\n\\ninterdependence across the team network (de dreu, 2007), and thus, an overt focus on\\n\\nintra-agency information can distract decision-makers from collective goals and\\n\\nbehaviours (comfort, 2007; de dreu, 2007). by solely communicating agency-specific\\n\\ninformation, there is the risk of an ‘information starvation’ effect within the multiteam\\nsystem, where important information is not shared with the wider team, a prevalent\\n\\nproblemduring emergency response (netten, bruinsma, van someren, & dehoog, 2006).\\n\\nalthough a decentralized approach to multiteam systems may usefully allow experts to\\n\\nfocus on their own specialisms (house et al., 2014), if this occurs in the absence of\\n\\ninteragency coordination of efforts, then thismeans that key decisions and actionsmay be\\n\\nmissed or redundantly duplicated (brannick et al., 1992). interagency communication is\\n\\nessential to facilitate a shared understanding of the requirements of the dynamic decision\\n\\nenvironment.\\none barrier that we predicted would reduce decisions and actions was a lack of\\n\\ndeadlines or specific time demands. individuals avoid difficult choiceswhen possible (van\\n\\nden heuvel et al., 2012) and so when critical issues were non-time-bounded, we found\\n\\nthat teams failed to communicate interagency decisions and actions.we acknowledge, as\\n\\nwith most ndm research, that we cannot conclude a causal relationship between time\\n\\ndemands and decision outcomes, but existing literature may help explain it. it is possible\\n\\nthat a lack of deadlines induced inaction as teams tried to avoid potential anticipated\\n\\nnegative emotions, such as anticipated regret (anderson, 2003). individuals may have\\nutilized more selective search strategies when evaluating options because they felt they\\n\\nhad the time to do so. indeed,when decision-makers are placed under time pressure, then\\n\\nthey tend to use time-saving processes such as satisficing to reach a choice (simon, 1956);\\n\\nyet when deadlines are absent, individuals use more selective alternative-based\\n\\nprocessing to continually deliberate on potential courses of action to find the ‘best’\\n\\ndecision inertia 315\\n\\n\\n\\noption (parker & schrift, 2011). we suggest that when a critical issue was non-time-\\n\\nbounded, teams redundantly sought further information about the choice from within\\n\\ntheir own agency, rather than committing to a joint choice with other agencies.\\n\\nthe involvement ofmore than two agencies also reduced communication ondecisions\\nand actions. it is possible that an increase in team size reduced the ‘psychological\\n\\nownership’ over decision outcomes due to diluted feelings of responsibility and\\n\\naccountability (kroon et al., 1991; pierce et al., 2001). agencies must keep one another\\n\\ninformed of their actions in multiteam systems to orchestrate the smooth sequencing of\\n\\nactivity (healey, hodgkinson, & teo, 2009), yet when responsibility is diluted, roles and\\n\\nresponsibilities are confused (bearman et al., 2010). role confusion can permeate both\\n\\nintra- and interagency action to reduce the overall effectiveness of the multiagency team\\n\\n(quarantelli, 1985). an increase in team size may further decrease the level of trust\\nthroughout the teamnetwork. trust is reflected by awillingness of the trustor to take risks\\n\\nbased upon advice received from the trustee (mayer et al., 1995) and within multiteam\\n\\nnetworks the building of trust is based upon reciprocity (rusman et al., 2010). when\\n\\nteam size was larger, agencies may have focused on information concerning their own\\n\\nteam due to poor trust within the wider multiteam network. fundamentally, any increase\\n\\nin interagency team size means that individuals can ‘hide in the crowd’ and avoid taking\\n\\nresponsibility for action (kroon et al., 1991).\\n\\na further barrier associated with reduced interagency action was when there was a\\nlack of clear superordinate direction (lepine et al., 2008). interestingly, not only was a\\n\\nlack of strategic direction associated with intra-agency information seeking, but when\\n\\nstrategic directionwas present, this appeared to increase interagency communications on\\n\\n‘actions’, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. in otherwords, a lack of strategy reduced\\n\\naction, whilst strategic direction facilitated action. unclear goals at a strategic level may\\n\\nhave reduced cooperation as decision-makers were distracted by their own intra-agency\\n\\ngoals (de bruijn, 2006). intra- and interagency goals tend to compete (sonnenwald &\\n\\npierce, 2000) and so if strategic goals are unclear, then intra-agency goals aremore salient.\\nitwas found thatwhen strategic goalswere set, discussions became focusedon facilitating\\n\\naction, which was judged by the smes as necessary. effective communications are\\n\\nessential for facilitating action in multiteam systems where different backgrounds and\\n\\nculturesmustwork together towards an effective resolution (bearman et al., 2010) and so\\n\\nstrategic goals must be set with clear meaning and intent (keyton & beck, 2010). this is\\n\\nachieved by establishing reciprocal relationships to develop a shared understanding and\\n\\nteamcognition (cooke,gorman,&rowe, 2009). thus,when strategic direction is lacking\\n\\neither completely or due to implicit assumptions, then teamwork failed to be\\ninterdependent and goal-focused (salas, cook, & rosen, 2008); yet when strategy is\\n\\nclear, it can facilitate the implementation of action in multiteam networks.\\n\\nconclusion and implications\\n\\nour research has bothmethodological and applied implications. firstly, we demonstrated\\n\\nhow ndm can be used to research failures to make decisions. whereas traditional\\n\\nlaboratory-based decision experiments treat the absence of choice as a null effect, ndm’s\\nemphasis on context and real-world choice allows us to explore the dynamic and\\n\\ninterrelating processing associated with decision inertia. in addition, our research\\n\\nprovides a worked example of howndm allows for both practitioners and academics can\\n\\ncombine training and research to derive mutually beneficial conclusions. secondly, we\\n\\nfound that the barriers of non-time-bounded choice, large team size, and a failure to set\\n\\n316 laurence alison et al.\\n\\n\\n\\nclear strategic direction can inhibit multiteam system decision-making, a finding that\\n\\nrequires further investigation. for example, experts can adapt to time pressure efficiently\\n\\nusing satisficing strategies (klein, 2008), and so itwouldbe interesting to explorewhether\\n\\nexperts are more willing to take action despite the absence of deadlines or whether they\\nwill continue to avoid choice if the opportunity arises. it may also be possible to conduct\\n\\ncognitive task analysis (cta) style interviews in order to unpack how these variables\\n\\ninfluence the cognitive processing of emergency workers in real life (crandall et al.,\\n\\n2006) or to compare differences in decision-making styles between ‘critical’ decisions and\\n\\nthose that are less ‘high-stake’. as strategic goals facilitated interagency communications\\n\\nof decisions and actions, this highlights the importance of superordinate goals during\\n\\nemergency response command and control, creating clear implications for effective\\n\\ntraining of practitioners.\\n'"
